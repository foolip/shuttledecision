FACE="Geneva">105</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] A key component of
early Space Shuttle plans was its linkage to a possible mission to
Mars as the next major NASA undertaking. During 1967 and 1968, the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) reached key milestones in propulsion
on the road to Mars. In tests in Nevada, the AEC conducted successful
demonstrations of nuclear reactors built for use in rocket propulsion
and showed that its contractors were ready to develop a flight-rated
engine suitable for piloted missions to that
planet.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nuclear Rocket Engines</FONT></I></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The AEC's nuclear-rocket program could trace
its beginnings to December 1953, when the nuclear scientist Robert
Bussard published an article on this topic in the classified
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Journal of Reactor Science and
Technology</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. His paper stirred
interest, and led to the initiation of an experimental effort called
Project Rover at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Initial work aimed at
building a succession of rocket reactors named Kiwi after the
flightless bird of New Zealand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The basic approach followed Bussard's
proposal, calling for a compact reactor built of graphite, which
withstands high temperatures and actually gains strength when heated.
Hydrogen, flowing through channels in this reactor core, would
receive heat from the reactor and reach temperatures of
[<A NAME="106"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">106</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] several thousand degrees. This gas would then expand
and flow through a nozzle, to produce thrust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such a rocket appeared highly promising
because it offered the greatest possible exhaust velocity and hence
the best performance. It would do this by taking advantage of
hydrogen's low molecular weight: two, in appropriate units, compared
with 18 for water vapor and 44 for carbon dioxide. Molecules of low
weight fly faster, and hence yield a higher exhaust velocity; for
this purpose, hydrogen is best. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first version of Kiwi was heavy and
produced only 70 megawatts (MW) of power, a modest amount. When it
ran for five minutes in mid-1959, however, it suggested strongly that
nuclear propulsion indeed was worth pursuing. Some NASA officials had
already been following this work; now they joined with their AEC
counterparts to set up a joint program office. Los Alamos managers
laid plans for advanced Kiwi reactors that would aim at 1,000
megawatts. In addition to this, the joint office set a follow-on goal
of developing a flight-rated engine called NERVA (Nuclear Engine for
Rocket Vehicle Application). In June 1961, NASA and the AEC chose
Aerojet General as the prime contractor for development of the
complete nuclear engine, with Westinghouse, an experienced builder of
reactors, as the principal subcontractor. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In November 1962, during a test of a new and
promising Kiwi, disaster struck. The analyst James Dewar writes that
"paralleling the rapid increase in power was a rapid increase in the
frequency of flashes of light from the nozzle. On reaching 500 MW,
the flashes were so spectacular and so frequent that the test was
terminated and shut-down procedures begun. Quick disassembly
confirmed that the flashes of light were reactor parts being ejected
from the nozzle. Further disassembly and analysis revealed that over
90 percent of the reactor parts had been broken, mostly at the core's
hot end."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Harold Finger, head of the joint office,
decided that there would be no further hot tests until the cause of
the failure was found and carefully fixed. The failure was found to
have been caused by vibrations produced by gas flowing through the
core, which cracked the uranium fuel elements. It took over a year
and a half of new designs to restore confidence in the project. In
the end, [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">107</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] vibration-free reactor cores proved to be attainable.
In August 1964, another Kiwi ran for eight minutes at 900 MW, with
complete success. The engineers then restarted it and successfully
ran it again at full power. This series of tests....</FONT></P>

achieve. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other work improved the non-nuclear parts of
the rocket. The AEC test facility included a liquid-hydrogen pump
that served well during the ground tests, but was unsuitable for
flight. During 1965, however, workers assembled a complete nuclear
engine that included a hydrogen-cooled nozzle as well as a
flight-type turbopump. Tests of this engine began that December and
reached full power in March 1966. This was the first operation of a
nuclear rocket with major components representative of a flight-rated
engine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Subsequent work returned anew to reactor
development, emphasizing long-duration tests as well as high power.
In December 1967, an experimental version of NERVA carried through a
60-minute endurance run at rated temperature and full power, 3630
degrees Fahrenheit and 1100 MW. In addition to this, Los Alamos was
developing a new class of reactors called Phoebus, rated at 5000 MW.
A June 1968 test ran for over 30 minutes, with 12 minutes at or above
4000 MW.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then plans were in hand for a true flight
engine, with 1560 MW of power and temperatures of 4040&deg; F. It would
produce a thrust of 75,000 pounds with an exhaust velocity of 26,500
ft/sec, nearly twice that of the best hydrogen-oxygen rocket then
available. This version of NERVA would not take off from the ground,
but would serve in upper stages. The plans called for developing this
engine through a Preliminary Flight Rating Test, a pre-flight
qualification. It would be ready for actual space missions soon after
1975. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The rapid pace of advances in Nevada
contrasted painfully with the lack of plans in Washington. With NASA
having no approved post-Apollo future, it was quite possible to
anticipate a time when Aerojet might build a well-tested NERVA, ready
for flight, only to find that NASA had no reason to use it. NASA's
prospects did not improve during 1968, as the agency launched a new
attempt to plan its future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This new planning effort began that February
when NASA Administrator Webb named Homer Newell to direct it. Newell,
who had headed the Office of Space Science and Applications, had been
promoted to Associate [<A NAME="109"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">109</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Administrator in
October 1967, giving him agency-wide responsibility. He hoped to
prepare proposals that could influence the FY 1970 budget request
that would go to the Bureau of the Budget (BoB) late in September. He
proceeded to set up 12 working groups, drawing on a broad range of
NASA specialists. A Planning Coordination Group (PCG) would direct
the working groups' activities; a Planning Steering Group then would
choose alternatives and pass recommendations to the
Administrator.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This effort accomplished little. The head of
the PCG noted "a definite failure to pull together among the key
program offices, science and manned space
flight."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The son of a naval commodore, Paine served in
World War II as a radar and engineering officer aboard the submarine
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">USS Pompon</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">. The experience stayed with him; decades later,
trapped in a boring meeting, he would fill the time by drawing a
sketch of his submarine under way on the surface and ready for
action. After receiving a Ph.D. in physical metallurgy at Stanford
University in 1949, he joined the General Electric (GE) Research
Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. In this company, he rose to
manager of engineering applications. In 1963, he returned to the West
Coast and became head of TEMPO, a GE think tank in Santa Barbara,
California. From this position, he went on to become Webb's deputy at
NASA in January 1968. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like a good Navy man, he hit the ground
running. Though still recovering from the Apollo fire during that
year, NASA was pushing forward in [<A NAME="112"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">112</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] expectation of
meeting President Kennedy's goal of a piloted lunar landing by the
end of 1969. The Apollo spacecraft, well along in development, would
soon be ready to carry its crew of three. The Saturn V, in flight
test, soon would be ready as well. However, a vital element of
Apollo, the lunar module, was encountering delays. This spacecraft,
with room for two astronauts, was to carry out the actual landing on
the moon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Saturn V was to carry a complete moonship,
comprised of both an Apollo spacecraft and a lunar module, with the
latter being flight-tested in both Earth and lunar orbits before it
could qualify for the demanding task of a lunar landing. Its delay in
development, however, raised the prospect that a Saturn V might be
ready for launch, with only the Apollo spacecraft qualified for
flight as its payload.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston,
George Low, head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, was ready
to accept this. He recommended that the mission leave the lunar
module on the ground, but send the Apollo spacecraft into lunar
orbit, allowing its crew to circle the moon repeatedly before
breaking out of that orbit to return to earth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In August 1968, Webb and Mueller - both out of
the country attending a United Nations conference in Vienna - left
Paine in Washington to mind the store. Sam Phillips, the Apollo
program director, told him of Low's proposal. Paine, who found the
concept exciting, gave it his full support. He then tried to sell it
to Webb, as both he and Phillips talked to their Administrator via
overseas telephone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Webb was shocked at the audacity of the idea,
and yelled, "Are you out of your mind?" They had not even flown a
piloted Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit. In addition to this, Webb
viewed the lunar module as a lifeboat that could save the crew of a
lunar mission if their Apollo spacecraft were to become
disabled.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Any piloted lunar mission would be dangerous; to fly
without a lunar module would make it more so. In turn, the deaths of
additional astronauts, in the wake of the Apollo fire, would shake
NASA to its foundations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, Webb did not say no; he left the
door open. When Paine then strengthened his argument by sending Webb
a long cable, Webb grudgingly agreed to consider this proposal, at
least for purposes of planning. Events now played into Paine's hands.
In September, the Soviet Union carried out an
[<A NAME="113"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">113</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] important lunar mission, Zond 5. This spacecraft
looped around the moon, returned to earth, reentered the atmosphere,
came down in the Indian Ocean, and was recovered. Two turtles were
aboard, and they came back safely. An impressed Webb described this
flight as "the most important demonstration of total space capacity
up to now by any nation."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Zond 5 raised the stakes. All along the goal
of Apollo had been to beat Moscow to the moon; yet by sending a
cosmonaut in place of the turtles, the Soviets could still win the
race with another Zond mission. While Zond would only loop around and
not land on the moon, if cosmonauts were to do this, they would
become the first pilots to fly to the moon. Subsequent Apollo
landings then would appear merely as following in Soviet
footsteps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During that same September, Webb announced
that he would step down as NASA Administrator. He had held that post
since 1961; he now would turn it over to Paine, who would serve as
Acting Administrator until the next president, due to be elected in
November, could name a new head of NASA. Webb's resignation took
effect early in October and left Paine free to make decisions as
opposed to only recommendations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In that same month, the Apollo 7 mission
successfully flew with three astronauts in Earth orbit, as they
tested their spacecraft during an 11-day mission. This exorcised the
ghosts of the Apollo fire, and led within weeks to the commitment
Paine had sought. Having flown successfully in Earth orbit, the
Apollo spacecraft, sans lunar module, indeed would fly to the moon on
the next mission. The flight that resulted, Apollo 8, carried the
astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders. On
Christmas Eve 1968, much of the world listened as a radio circuit
carried their voices, live from lunar orbit:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Apollo 8 reflected Paine's leadership and
initiative, which he had displayed even while Webb still headed NASA.
That mission also reflected a characteristic boldness, a willingness
to reach for new horizons; this too was part of Paine's approach. He
would display such boldness time and again during his tenure, as he
pushed his colleagues to think more daring thoughts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In several respects, however, Paine's position
was weaker than that of Webb. Webb had served the Truman
Administration as director of the Budget Bureau from 1946 to 1949,
and as Under Secretary of State from 1949 to 1952. Though Republicans
held the White House during the subsequent eight years, Webb's
background made him a charter member of the Democrats' shadow
government, ready to receive an important sub-cabinet post when they
regained the presidency in 1960.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine had no such background. He held no
record of government service, or even of involvement in the space
program as a technical manager. In the words of the historian John
Logsdon, "he was as new to the ways of Washington as James Webb had
been a master of them." Paine had obtained
[<A NAME="115"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">115</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] his initial selection as Deputy Administrator because
he had offered himself for appointment to a high-level Washington
position, nature unspecified. The head of the Civil Service
Commission found Paine's name in a list of executives who had
expressed interest in receiving such posts, and passed it on.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the new president, Richard Nixon, free to
name his own NASA Administrator, Paine submitted a pro forma
resignation upon Nixon's inauguration in January 1969. Nixon's staff
offered the post to candidates that included General Bernard
Schriever, who had built the Air Force's big missiles; Simon Ramo, a
co-founder of TRW who had provided Schriever with vital technical
support; and Patrick Haggerty, head of Texas Instruments. When all
declined, Nixon decided to stick with Paine. Continuing as Acting
Administrator, Paine received Senate confirmation as Administrator,
without qualification, in March 1969. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">16</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was less to this than met the eye, for
in no way did Nixon intend to endorse Paine's bold approach to space
flight. "He was not committed to space," recalls Hans Mark, director
of NASA's Ames Research Center and later an Air Force undersecretary.
"Nixon had no real interest in it. He didn't want to be the president
that would kill our space program, but he had no personal interest in
it at all."</FONT></P>

Continue</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Amid drama near the moon and change in
Washington, NASA plugged ahead, as space shuttle studies continued to
receive their modest share of attention. As early as October 1966, a
meeting in Houston brought together officials from NASA Headquarters,
NASA-Marshall, and the Manned Spacecraft Center. They began to plan a
joint study of space shuttles to provide logistics for a space
station. A month earlier, a joint Air Force-NASA study had concluded
that "no single, most desirable vehicle concept could be
identified... for satisfying future DoD and NASA
objectives."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

participants in the Houston meeting hoped to create a united front
within NASA. Noting the substantial number of studies already
available, Daniel Schnyer, representing the Office of Manned Space
Flight, declared that "we have a vast store of knowledge to draw on,
and should now be able to get together and decide on an agency
concept for the entire logistic system."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This meeting was sufficiently noteworthy for
Max Akridge, a representative from NASA-Marshall, to describe it as
"the beginning of the space shuttle as such."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Little came of
it; as George Mueller learned when he hosted his symposium in January
1968, various groups and designers were still pursuing their
individual approaches. At least NASA-Marshall would now work in
tandem with the Manned Spacecraft Center. This joint approach was in
the forefront when, in October 1968, managers from these two centers
launched a new round of space shuttle studies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Why could NASA not order up a definitive
treatment of some particular concept, such as Lockheed's
Star-Clipper, and be done with it? NASA needed such studies because
there was no way to get such a definitive treatment, at
[<A NAME="117"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">117</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] least not with the modest sums available to
underwrite individual studies. Like professors reviewing a graduate
student's dissertation, senior managers could always read the report
of a particular study and raise new questions, new topics for further
examination. Similarly, like grad students who look for jobs wherein
they can continue their dissertation research, engineers and managers
were eager to carry forward with new design exercises and further
analyses. They would continue to do this as long as funding remained
available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">George Mueller was the man behind the new
activity. In the wake of the 1968 election, his hopes were high. In
mid-December, just prior to the launch of Apollo 8, he talked with
Wernher von Braun and chided him: "You'd been telling me that my
space shuttle was in the future and you needed an interim system,"
such as the Titan III-M. Mueller predicted that the new president
would want to go "all out," adding that "this may be the big program
for Nixon." Von Braun replied, "If Nixon wants to spend $3 billion,
who am I to say no?" </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Initial activity revolved around a formal
Request for Proposal, issued October 30. It represented an invitation
for interested companies to describe the studies they hoped to
conduct. Responses were due by the end of November. In the parlance
of the day, the spacecraft under consideration were described anew as
Integrated Launch and Reentry Vehicles, with the new studies
representing a continuation of work funded by the Air Force under
that designation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The study contracts, signed at the end of
January 1969, called for all designs to follow a common set of ground
rules. The Statement of Work defined the basic mission as the
resupply of a space station, in an orbit with 55-degree inclination.
Each vehicle was to carry 12 people, as passengers and crew, or a
payload of 25,000 pounds. Contractors were also to present variations
of their basic designs, to accommodate payloads ranging from 5,000 to
50,000 pounds. Payload bays were to provide cargo volume of at least
3,000 cubic feet; when returning from orbit, these vehicles were to
carry at least 2,500 pounds. Designers were to seek to achieve
aircraft-like checkout and ease of maintenance, including readiness
for rapid launch in as little as 24 hours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American Aviation (NAA), which now had
the name of North American Rockwell after having merged with the firm
of Rockwell International, took a contract.. It was to study new,
low-cost, expendable [<A NAME="118"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">118</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] boosters with
reusable upper stages. Having ruled out existing expendables such as
the Saturn I-B or Titan III-C, NASA welcomed new concepts.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lockheed was told to concentrate its effort on
new studies of stage-and-a-half configurations such as the
Star-Clipper. The new topics would include use of solid- or
liquid-fueled booster stages that would ignite at liftoff. (Here was
another glimpse of the future; the final shuttle configuration, three
years later, would use such solid boosters.) In addition to this,
Lockheed was to develop its own versions of the Triamese concept for
comparison with those of General Dynamics (GD).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">GD focused on two-stage fully-reusable
approaches, excluding stage-and-a-half designs. GD's configurations
therefore demanded a "flyback first stage," capable of returning to
the launch site, and this firm's engineers were to consider unpiloted
concepts. The Triamese approach was to remain an important though not
predominant focus of effort. At the same time, NASA officials raised
a new question: Is there a way to design a flyback first stage that
could develop into a Triamese vehicle?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">McDonnell Douglas, home of the Tip Tank
stage-and-a-half concept, was to study it anew. Like Lockheed, this
firm was to look at the use of booster stages; in addition to this,
its investigators would study fully-reusable concepts. These became
central to this company's efforts as the study progressed during
1969.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At first glance, these contracts promised more
of the same. One could see a few new faces in the crowd. Martin
Marietta failed to win a study contract while North American
Rockwell, builder of the Apollo spacecraft and the second stage of
the Saturn V, won instead. The promised concepts, however, amounted
to new variations on old themes. No one was offering anything so
original as Max Hunter's stage-and-a-half approach, and each of the
four studies had only $300,000 in funding. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the light of subsequent events, one notes
particularly the strong emphasis on space station logistics. The
study requirements placed little weight on contractor concepts that
would specialize in carrying automated spacecraft as payloads. Yet
there was a reason for this focus on space-station logistics: Tom
Paine wanted such a station, and was pushing hard in Washington to
win approval to build it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">George Mueller believed strongly in convening
advisory boards, and in sponsoring studies of future programs. One of
his ongoing panels, the Science and Technology Advisory Committee
(STAC), sought to bring top-level scientists into consultation with
his Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). Many scientists were
strongly skeptical of the OMSF and its works; they regarded Apollo as
a costly extravagance, and argued instead for less costly automated
spacecraft. STAC scientists, who at least were not vocal in their
opposition, gave OMSF access to high-quality scientific advice. It
also offered a counter to criticism from the scientific community.
The chairman of STAC, Charles Townes, was a physicist who had shared
a Nobel Prize for work leading to the invention of the laser.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In December 1968, a month after the election,
Townes agreed to chair an advisory group that would make
recommendations to the new administration on space policy. The
group's members included Robert Seamans, who had been NASA's Deputy
Administrator. Other members, including Townes, had served on the
President's Science Advisory Committee panel that had prepared the
1967 report, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Space Program in the
Post-Apollo Period</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Townes's group included at least one true
believer: Francis Clauser, vice-chancellor of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, who was about to take over as chairman of
the college of engineering at Caltech. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On the whole, however, the new report was
considerably more cautious in tone than the PSAC review of 1967. On
NASA's future, Townes' panelists agreed that "we do not recommend a

development of "low-cost boosters,' or a manned planetary
expedition." The panel called for "a new look...at the balance
between the manned and unmanned segments of the NASA space program."
Tantamount to asserting that the existing program was badly out of
balance, the report proposed redress: "an active and successful
manned program for several years while at the same time steadily
decreasing the level of funding for manned space flight to perhaps
$1.25 billion by fiscal 1972."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then Nixon was in the White House and was
dealing with the Federal budget. Preparing a budget for a particular
fiscal year took time; though elected in 1968 and inaugurated in
1969, the first budget that would be truly Nixon's own would cover FY
1971. At the moment he was dealing with the budget for FY 1970 that
would begin in mid-1969. Like other new presidents, Nixon, seeking to
contrast his own financial prudence with the spendthrift ways of his
predecessor, ordered his department heads to look for ways to make
cuts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new Director of the Bureau of the Budget,
Robert Mayo, wrote a government-wide letter to those heads of
agencies on January 23, asking them to review their portions of

</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo slapped this down in a hurry. It took him
only a few days to reply with a letter to Paine: "I am not prepared
at this time to recommend to the President approval of your requested
budget increase." He also wrote to Nixon: "Our first look at the
agency recommendations...shows many more increases than decreases. In
total these requests, if granted, would make precarious if not
impossible the attainment of the surplus forecast by the previous
Administration." He advised the President to "make no statements
endorsing future space objectives" pending extensive further review,
which would include "the total budget context." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo's staff went on to request a $90 million
cut in the NASA budget, where Paine had sought a $198 million
increase. While Paine succeeded in winning some relief, the final BoB
cut still came to $45 million. Part of a $5.5

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, the Nixon Administration was
preparing to chart its own course toward that future, with Paine
having a hand in the planning. In December, during the transition
between administrations, Nixon had selected Lee DuBridge, the
president of Caltech, to be his new science advisor. At Caltech,
DuBridge's purview had included the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the
nation's principal center for automated exploration of the moon and
planetsoperated by this university under contract to NASA. Like many
of his fellow scientists, however, DuBridge was skeptical of the
value of piloted space flight. He favored paying greater attention to
automated missions, and he knew them well. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Townes panel had cast its net broadly,

with the Defense Department, and even matters that could require new
legislation in Congress. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The economist
Arthur Burns, a Nixon advisor, proposed that DuBridge should direct a
new study that would further address these issues. On February 4,
Nixon responded with a memo to DuBridge:</FONT></P>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The report from Arthur Burns'
   group...proposes the establishment of an interagency committee
   which would include you, the Administrator of NASA, and a senior
   official from the Department of Defense. The primary function of
   this committee would be to furnish recommendations to me on the
   scope and direction of our Post Apollo Space Program.

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the president's science advisor, DuBridge
served as director of the Office of Science and Technology (OST), one
of a myriad of special-purpose [<A NAME="124"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">124</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] bureaus within the
Executive Branch. OST staff members proceeded to draft a directive
which represented an attempt to give DuBridge the leadership of this
review of space policy. No NASA officials took part in drafting this
directive, for in the words of one OST staffer, Russell Drew, "there
was a concern that we would be called upon to rubber-stamp a NASA
document, which we did not want to do." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Learning of this ploy, Paine protested
strongly. He disliked the idea that DuBridge and the OST might
present him with plans sanctioned by Nixon that he then would have to
execute; as he later put it, "You never want one bunch of guys to do
the planning and another bunch to carry it out." Nevertheless,
Paine's position was quite weak at that moment. He was no more than
Acting Administrator, and because he had sent in his resignation, he
was merely serving from day to day at Nixon's pleasure, pending
appointment of a replacement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Regardless Paine, a Democrat in a nest of

rather typical Washington power struggle." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If not the OST and Lee DuBridge, who would
direct this interagency study? The answer lay in the original Space
Act of 1958 that had created a policymaking
[<A NAME="125"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">125</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] body, the National Aeronautics and Space Council
(NASC). Its members included representatives from all federal
agencies with an important interest in space: NASA, the DoD, the AEC
and the State Department, the latter because the space program
required overseas tracking stations and featured cooperation with
scientists of other nations. Though by law, the Vice-President
chaired this body, it had never done much. The recent Townes panel
described it as "not very effective," noting that Nixon might ask
Congress to abolish it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The ineffectiveness of the NASC matched that
of its new chairman, Vice-President Spiro Agnew. He was in a position
familiar to new vice-presidents, for he had little to do and was
looking for ways to make himself useful. In Paine's words, "at that
time, he hadn't figured out what his role was going to be in the
administration." He willingly agreed to chair the new interagency
review, which would go forward within a committee called the Space
Task Group (STG). </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On February 13, Nixon issued a new memo
confirming this arrangement. DuBridge was to join the STG and provide
its staff. Paine would also be a member. Nixon initially designated
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird as a third member. Laird, however,
chose instead to appoint a representative: Robert Seamans, lately the
number two man in NASA and now recalled from MIT to become the new
Air Force Secretary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The group held an initial meeting on March 7,
with Agnew in the chair. This meeting served to organize the group's
activities. Nixon had directed the STG "to prepare for me a
coordinated program and budget proposal"; hence it was appropriate to
invite Robert Mayo, director of the Budget Bureau, to sit with the
group as an observer. The STG issued similar invitations to two
others: Glenn Seaborg, chairman of the AEC, and U. Alexis Johnson,
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">35</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Already Paine was wooing Agnew vigorously, for
Agnew had no background in space - he had been governor of Maryland -
but now proved amenable to Paine's bold planning. The Apollo 9
mission flew during that month, atop a Saturn V, which carried a
lunar module into earth orbit along with three astronauts in an
Apollo spacecraft. This represented the first test flight of a
[<A NAME="126"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">126</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] complete moonship. Paine invited Agnew to come to
Cape Canaveral on the day of the launch, as an honored guest. While
DuBridge and Seamans were there, it was Agnew who received special
treatment. He was given a tour of the moonport, with astronauts as
his escorts. These included Frank Borman, who had commanded Apollo 8.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">36</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The STG held a second meeting two weeks later.
Seamans, seeing "considerable military interest and potential use"
for a shuttle, won agreement that a joint NASA/DoD panel would study
it anew. Paine called for "a new banner to be hoisted," as daring as
Apollo, around which the nation might rally. Agnew pursued this
thought: Where was the Apollo of the 1970s? Could it be that the
United States should undertake a manned expedition to Mars? The
issue, however, flickered only momentarily for it was too early for
such plans to catch fire. Agnew and Paine, however, would return to
this topic anew in subsequent months. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">37</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Townes study, the setting-up of the STG,
and Paine's attempt to boost his budget all took place between
December 1968 and the following March. For Paine, the record was
mixed. He sat and watched while Townes' panelists proposed to do
little in space that was new. He had lost in his opening encounter
with Mayo. He had succeeded, however, in shaping the STG to his
liking and had reason to think he would have Agnew as an ally, with
Seamans as another highly knowledgeable participant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second STG meeting was the last such
full-dress meeting until August. During the intervening months,
participants would call on planning groups to develop specific
proposals. Paine was already doing this, for while he might have
little clout at the Budget Bureau, on his own turf he was king. He
wanted a space station and a great deal more, and was already working
with colleagues to determine the designs.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine Seeks a Space

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was little fundamentally new in the
realm of space shuttle design; the same was true of space stations.
The studies of the 1960s had emphasized concepts such as the Manned
Orbiting Research Laboratory of Douglas
[<A NAME="127"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">127</FONT></B><FONT

using the Saturn I-B for logistics. This approach had continued to

one NASA official put it, "What congressman would dare vote against
anything called MOM?" </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

   was to be put into a 1,075-mile altitude high-inclination
   orbit....</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet though Paine was sounding a clarion call,
in a vital respect he was blowing an uncertain trumpet, for his
center directors lacked clear direction as to what they were to
produce. They were quite ready to boldly go where no one had gone
before, but their engineers needed more than </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">2001: A Space Odyssey</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
when drawing up their specifications. In particular, they needed a
well-drawn Statement of Work to direct the new space station studies.
Paine, addressing this issue as well, had recently convened a meeting
of those directors for this purpose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The draft Statement of Work of that moment was
the seventh in a series, and everyone agreed it left much to be
desired. Abe Silverstein of NASA-Lewis, who had received Paine's
letter of mid-January, cited three criteria in evaluating the draft:
"Would contractors receiving this in the mail know what to do? Could
we evaluate their responses? Could the project be completed to meet
our specs within time and money?"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He added that "the number-seven draft document
fails to meet these criteria and cannot be edited to meet these
criteria. NASA is asking - in mushy language - for something we
should know ourselves before going out." He then gave a list of
"things we need to do more homework on": size, weight, orbits,
programs and experiments, power, logistic support, and
communications. "We need to define all these factors for the
contractors," he concluded. "In essence, tell them clearly what NASA
wants. We need a document that defines the basics."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With even the basics left undefined, Robert
Gilruth of the Manned Spacecraft Center was willing to fill in the
blanks in a very expansive spirit: </FONT></P>

   "space base' can grow in an efficient orderly evolution through
   1985. We should start in 1975 to launch the basic core of the
   space station or space base that we want to be operating in 1980,

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This meeting took place late in January. Over
the next several weeks Charles Mathews, George Mueller's deputy at
the OMSF in Washington, developed new guidelines that now called for
two space stations: an initial concept for the short term and a
blue-sky version as a follow-on project. However, the latter would
show a close relation to the former, for the initial space station
would serve as a module or building block. By launching several of
them and linking them together in orbit, NASA could assemble a true
space base, with accommodation for as many as a 100 people.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This brought a highly compelling concept for a
space station program that could extend through the 1970s and beyond.
The basic space station would not resemble MORL, with its crew of
six. Instead, it was to provide room for as many as 12 people. It
would have a diameter of 33 feet, compared to the 22 feet of MORL,
and would fly on the Saturn V. NASA would resupply this station using
the Saturn I-B or the Titan III-M, with the chosen launch vehicle
carrying a modified Gemini spacecraft called Big G. The standard
Gemini had carried two people; Big G would retain that spacecraft as
a cockpit or flight deck, while adding a passenger section with 7 to
10 additional seats.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="130"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">130</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] This station would
be in orbit as early as 1975. Modules of similar size, brought up on
their own Saturn V vehicles, would then build it into the final space
base, with enough people to fill an office building. After 1975, a
space shuttle would become available, and would replace Big G along
with its expendable booster. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">42</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Here indeed was the boldness Paine wanted.
Part of what made this scenario exciting was that, in its essence, it
called for no more than a modest extension of concepts with which
everyone was familiar. The new station would represent something of a
stretch when compared with MORL, but its design would rest solidly on
the foundation of earlier studies, and it would use the Saturn V. Its
logistics vehicle was old hat; the Big G concept had been around
since 1967. The space base would evolve from the basic station in a
natural way, with a space shuttle - another well-known concept -
complementing it strongly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With these plans evolving rapidly, Paine
received a request from the White House, dated February 17, in which
Nixon solicited his views on issues of policy in space and
aeronautics. Paine responded by pouring out his heart in a nine-page
letter, again single-spaced. He wanted his space station, naturally,
and he not only wanted a presidential commitment; he wanted it
quickly. This letter represented an attempt to bypass the
deliberations of the Space Task Group, even though Paine was one of
its members. It also bypassed the normal budget process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That was awkward, but Paine and Nixon were
both aware that the STG would require the entire spring and summer to
carry through with its work, and Paine wrote that the matter was too
urgent to wait. He brashly played the Soviet card, warning that
Moscow was "pushing toward a dominant position in large-scale
long-duration space station operations in earth orbit.... Their
moving clearly ahead of the U.S. in this field would have a
continuing impact on the rest of the world." The Soviets might make
their move as early as that summer. This would "take the edge off
your announcement of a similar U.S. objective in the fall."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine knew his man. Nixon had lost the
presidency to Kennedy by a whisker-thin margin in 1960 partly because
Kennedy had warned that the [<A NAME="131"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">131</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Russians were ahead
of us in the space race. Nixon, however, refused to bite. He replied
to Paine with a courteous note that put the space station issue
firmly in the hands of the STG. The PSAC also declined to support
NASA, as Lewis Branscomb, chairman of its panel on space science and
technology, wrote that </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The work of Mathews and his colleagues now
gave a firm basis for a suitable Statement of Work that could guide
the new round of space-station studies. On April 19, this document
went out to prospective contractors. There would be two study
contracts of $2.9 million each, one managed by NASA-Marshall and the
other by the Manned Spacecraft Center, with NASA Headquarters
providing coordination. The studies were to put more than half their
efforts into defining the basic station with its crew of 12. These
studies were also to address issues involving logistic systems, along
with concept definition of the eventual space base.

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Space Shuttles Receive New
Attention</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Money talks, and the initial funding of the
1969 Space Shuttle studies showed that these held lower priority than
those of the space station. While the station studies came to $5.8
million, there was only $1.2 million at first for shuttle work. This
would be divided among four contractors who were to pursue their
studies for no more than six months. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">46</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Shuttles would now win new attention, for
these studies would feed into the work of the STG. George Mueller
then set up a program office almost overnight. To direct it, he
picked Leroy Day, an Apollo manager who was two levels down from him
on the organization chart. It was April; the Apollo 10 mission was
only weeks away, and Day was deeply immersed in preparation for a key
pre-launch review.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="132"></A></FONT><B><FONT

Mueller's office, expecting to discuss this upcoming flight, and saw
him covering a blackboard with notes on the space shuttle. Day knew
that this wouldn't concern him; it was completely foreign to him in
any case, so he waited politely for Mueller to finish. The following
discussion ensued:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was past four in the afternoon, and Day
felt that he was completely over his head. He felt even more
intimidated when Mueller said that they were to write a proposal for
the President's Space Task Group, which would go on to the White
House. Mueller assured him that he would not be alone: "You'll have
practically a blank check. You'll be able to get people - whoever you
need." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">47</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine was also taking action, in concert with
the new Air Force Secretary, Robert Seamans. Their staffs had
discussed the formal Terms of Reference for a new joint study of
space transportation. Less than three years earlier, a similar joint
study had found no design concept that could satisfy the needs of
both NASA and the Pentagon. The STG, however, had called for this new
[<A NAME="133"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">133</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] study, and Paine and Seamans agreed that it would go
forward in two parts. At first the DoD and NASA would work
separately, each defining the space shuttle concepts that would suit
its own needs. The two agencies then would work together, seeking to
meld their approaches, and would "recommend a preferred concept." A
joint committee would manage both phases of the effort, with the
co-chairmen being Mueller and Grant Hansen, Assistant Secretary of
the Air Force for Research and Development. The study was to be
brief; by mid-June, a joint report was to be ready for the STG.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">48</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in May, Mueller hosted a meeting of the
NASA Space Shuttle study contractors where he presented them with
some new rules. The mission of the Shuttle had emphasized space
station logistics, with a modest payload capacity of 25,000 pounds to
orbit, 3000 cubic feet, 2500 pounds returned from orbit. This
rationale now was broadening to include the launching of spacecraft,
many of which would require upper stages to reach high orbits.
Mueller told the attendees that "the principal carload capacity that
we would have would probably be liquid hydrogen. So that dictates a
fairly low density volume."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new rules called for a payload of 50,000
pounds carried both up and down, a volume of 10,000 cubic feet. The
payload bay could be 15 or even 22 feet in diameter, the latter
accommodating craft that would fit atop an S-IVB. This doubling of
the payload weight would bring a doubling in the shuttle's takeoff
weight. This would suit the Air Force, which had a strong interest in
large payloads and had built the Titan III-C to launch them.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mueller had been a professor of electrical
engineering during part of the 1950s. Drawing on this background, he
proceeded to lay out a new concept for the use of computers to
achieve rapid onboard checkout, and to present flight crews with the
information they would use during a mission. This concept would make
it possible for a small ground crew to carry out the preflight
checks, achieving true aircraft-like simplicity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mueller called for designers to equip
individual shuttle components, such as rocket engines, with sensors
that would monitor their condition. Each component would carry a
black box that would keep track of measured parameters. At any
moment, some parameters would stand within acceptable limits, while
others would lie outside such limits. Still other parameters would
[<A NAME="134"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">134</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] be within bounds at that moment, but would be
drifting toward unfavorable values. In response to a query from the
computer, each black box could answer in turn: "I am well," with all
parameters within limits. A particular box might answer, "I am sick,"
with one or more parameters outside the safe zone. Similarly, a box
might respond, "I am about to get sick," with a parameter drifting
toward danger. Further queries from the computer then could identify
the bad parameters and permit cures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mueller also wanted the onboard computer to
take the initiative in presenting data to the flight crew. While the
data would be available on flight-deck instruments, because there
would be many such instrument displays, a pilot might easily miss
something. Mueller preferred to "have the computer sweeping the cabin
and looking at the end points of the gages, and when one is going off
from where it ought to be it can flash and show you what the reading
is and what it ought to be and tell you what is wrong." With the
computer running a display, "it provides you with the information you
need when you need it, but it does not spread that information out
over so many instruments." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">49</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On May 19, two weeks after this meeting, Leroy
Day's task group submitted an initial report. It represented a
milestone in presenting the Space Shuttle concept as one that might
win serious support, for it broadened the rationale while narrowing
the range of acceptable design approaches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Since the early 1960s, shuttle advocates had
been bedeviled by a multiplicity of reusable launch-vehicle concepts,
all of which could claim the name of a shuttle. In their day these
had included boosters powered by scramjets or by LACE,
horizontal-takeoff vehicles employing a rocket sled, and behemoths
such as the Nexus that matched the weight of an ocean liner. These
had fallen by the wayside, but the range of concepts had remained
uncomfortably broad: expendable boosters with reusable upper stages,
stage-and-a-half partially-reusable configurations such as Lockheed's
Star-Clipper, two-stage fully-reusables such as General Dynamics's
Triamese. This was somewhat like having the Air Force propose to
build a new military airplane, without specifying whether it would be
a fighter, bomber, or transport.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The May 19 report now rejected the use of an
expendable booster. To meet Mueller's new requirements, such a launch
vehicle would have to be [<A NAME="135"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">135</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] larger than a
Saturn V. It might use a big solid-propellant first stage or rely on
low-cost liquid-fueled engines, making it cheaper to buy and fly.
This vehicle, however, would splash into the Atlantic every time one
of them flew-something that NASA was not about to do. After all, the
goal from the start had been to move well beyond the Saturn V, not to
develop it anew in a less costly version. In the words of the report,
"Fully reusable or near fully reusable systems offer the maximum
potential for an economic and versatile space shuttle system."</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The report also broadened the rationale. To
NASA, though not to the Air Force, a shuttle had primarily held the
promise of low-cost logistic support for a space station. That made
it a speculation nested within a speculation, for the station existed
only at the level of designs and dreams. The report now added several
attractive types of missions that reflected current practice or that
built on current activities in plausible ways. This broadened
rationale also made it more likely that NASA could come up with a
configuration that would win Air Force support, thus further widening
its usefulness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A shuttle might not only place satellites in
orbit; it could service them. Standard practice amounted to shooting
and hoping, as ground crews launched their rockets and trusted their
spacecraft to work. A shuttle crew, however, could check out a
satellite after carrying it to orbit, ensuring that it was
functioning properly. If a costly spacecraft failed in orbit, a
shuttle might fly up to fix it. A shuttle might also carry it to a
repair facility within a space station, or return it to earth for
rebuilding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This reusable launch vehicle could also be
large enough to carry the highly capable Centaur upper stage and
powerful enough to carry communications satellites or planetary
spacecraft of considerable size. This would lower the cost of such
launches, by taking advantage of the shuttle's reusability, without
compromising the demands of spacecraft designers by limiting this
service to payloads of only modest weight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A shuttle could also serve as an interim space
station, by carrying an instrumented and crew-tended module within
its payload bay. Such a mission might fly for up to thirty days. It
could be far less costly than Skylab, while offering duration,
internal volume, and onboard power considerably beyond that of
Apollo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Here was a new form of boldness: not a
warmed-over version of the </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> agenda, but a
well-grounded concept of a completely new approach
[<A NAME="136"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">136</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] to the space activities that were already under way
or approved. The report continued to list the prime shuttle mission
as "space station/base logistics support." Its breadth of rationale
for the first time raised the possibility that a shuttle program
might take on a life of its own, serving the nation even in the
complete absence of a station. On these terms, the Shuttle would
indeed go forward. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Space Task Group Members Prepare
Plans</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the STG, Paine represented NASA,
Seamans represented the DoD, and DuBridge spoke for the scientific
community. Though these leaders and their constituencies held
distinctly different views on the future of space flight, the STG
would have to reach a consensus if it was to speak with one voice.
Much of the work of the STG took place outside its infrequent formal
meetings, as these members commissioned studies that would define
their positions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA already had a well-established planning
procedure in place; Homer Newell, the Associate Administrator, had
set it up the previous year to develop program options that the
Administrator could present to the BoB. This procedure featured a
dozen working groups that drew broadly on specialists serving the
entire range of NASA activities, with one committee providing
coordination and a second committee - the Planning Steering Group -
choosing the options that would reach Paine's desk. Newell took on
the task of using this machinery to prepare the planning document
that Paine would take to the STG.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though he now held NASA-wide responsibility,
Newell had headed the Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA)
that dealt with automated spacecraft. OSSA had operated in the shadow
of the far more powerful Office of Manned Space Flight, and Mueller,
its director, was not about to defer to Newell when it came to
planning. Mueller had a planning group of his own at Bellcomm, a
branch of AT&amp;T with close ties to Bell Labs. This group had
furnished NASA with planning analyses during the Apollo program; it
too would readily serve the needs of the STG. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Newell and Mueller initiated their planning
exercises in December 1968, with the work of the Townes panel under
way. Though the STG still lay two [<A NAME="137"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">137</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] months in the
future, Newell hoped to influence the FY 1971 budget that would
become the subject of serious negotiation during 1969. During that
same December, Mueller convened another of his planning groups, the
Science and Technology Advisory Committee (STAC). In the course of
that month, Mueller told Von Braun that Nixon would go all-out and
pick the space shuttle as his big program. STAC reviewed the
prospects for piloted space flight and showed similar ebullience,
calling for "extensive exploration and initial colonization of the
moon," along with planetary missions that would include "a manned
expedition to the surface of Mars." STAC also strongly endorsed the
Shuttle, giving it highest priority and calling it "the keystone to
future development and large-scale practical application of the space
program." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">52</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Armed with this study, Mueller approached
Bellcomm. With two pages of handwritten notes, he joined a Bellcomm
staffer on a flight to Cape Canaveral late in March. The two men
discussed the outline of what Mueller wanted. It amounted to an
extension of the space station approach that was taking shape,
wherein a single module would serve as a building block for later
construction of a space base. Similarly, a minimum number of major
new systems were to serve as many roles as possible.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Spurred on by Paine's desire for boldness,
Newell's planners proceeded to develop a scenario calling for a
fast-paced effort that would emphasize space stations. The program
called for an initial station in 1975, with a crew of 12, followed
quickly by additional stations in polar orbit and in geosynchronous
orbit, the latter at an altitude of 22,300 miles. A space shuttle
would enter service during 1977. At the same time, other stations
would be operating in lunar orbit and on the moon's surface, while
NASA would begin to build an earth-orbiting space base for a crew of
50.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Newell did not ignore thoughts of piloted
flight to Mars. His working groups included a task force on planetary
exploration. During April he told its chairman, Donald Hearth, to
write a position paper on "a mid-'70s decision leading to a manned
Mars landing in the mid-1980s." Hearth's target date of 1986 gained
influence as it made its way upward through the planning process. In
July, a draft report for the STG, which reflected Newell's work,
proposed "that the United States begin preparing for a

disliked the overall approach of Newell's planning. In sowing the
earth-moon system thickly with space stations, Newell was repeating
the basic theme of the ambitious Apollo Applications wish list of a
few years earlier. Mueller knew from sad experience that this would
not work. He had tried it, and all he had produced was was the
Skylab. [<A NAME="139"></A></FONT><B><FONT

smacked of building space stations for their own sake, as if NASA was

set of projects that could carry it out. This plan resembled Leroy
Day's for the shuttle. Day's plan held a space base as a long-term
goal but asserted that the shuttle would pay its way in the nearer
future by launching and servicing payloads. Similarly, while Mueller
and Bellcomm aimed specifically at Mars, they expected to get there
by using rockets and spacecraft that would serve a broad range of
activities between the earth and the moon. The key was breadth of
application. A version of the plan presented to STAC that July stated
that "the program of developments and flight activities that comprise
the integrated space program will expand this nation's capacity for
space flight as far as foreseeable development in technology will
permit."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to the Space Shuttle and a space
station module, the plan called for three new program
elements:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Space Tug</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">:
This would serve as a general-purpose vehicle that would be based in
space, returning to earth only at rare intervals, if at all. It would
draw on the ability of the shuttle to carry propellants in
substantial quantities. The tug would operate as a "utility
propulsion module capable of transporting men, spacecraft and
equipment throughout cislunar space." It also would provide a ferry
from a lunar-orbiting space station to the moon's surface.</FONT>
</P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Astronaut-Tended Spacecraft</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">: These would include large automated telescopes in
orbit as well as automated applications satellites. They would be
designed to take advantage of the shuttle's capacity for revisit and
on-orbit maintenance, including the installation of upgraded
instruments by the flight crews.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nuclear Shuttle</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">: This reusable rocket would rely on the NERVA nuclear
engine. It would operate between low earth orbit, lunar orbit, and
geosynchronous orbit, with its exceptionally high performance
enabling it to carry heavy payloads and to do considerable amounts of
work with limited stores of liquid-hydrogen propellant. In turn, the
nuclear shuttle would receive this propellant from the Space
Shuttle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Space Shuttle, space tug and nuclear
shuttle together would constitute a complete reusable space
transportation system, with the tug and nuclear.... </FONT></P>

this system would serve an array of programs that would focus on
applications of a space station module. Variants of this module would
operate as components of a large space base, as stations in lunar
orbit and on the moon's surface, and as a geosynchronous
station.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">What of Mars? A piloted mission could use this
same equipment, with the nuclear shuttle providing propulsion for a
spaceship that would draw again on the basic space station module.
Mueller, like Newell, looked toward such a mission in 1986, defining
it also as an ultimate goal. Unlike Newell, however, he expected to
get to Mars with equipment that could find plenty of uses closer to
home. Just as Day's space shuttle might earn its keep even in the
absence of a space station, Mueller's integrated plan would serve the
nation even if NASA never received permission to send astronauts to
the Red Planet. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">55</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="141"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">141</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Mueller's
integrated plan came along a little too late to serve as the basis
for a July draft of NASA's report to the STG, setting forth the
agency's proposals. That draft drew principally on Newell's work,
adding a discussion of Mueller's plan as nothing more than an
appendix. Within a week, however, the appendix became the core of the
report. The reason for this, as one might expect, was Tom
Paine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Newell's Planning Steering Group (PSG) had
briefed Paine on its activities at the end of May. A dissatisfied
Paine saw the report as tantamount to stapling together the
contributions of its task groups, for the PSG at that moment had
nothing so succinct as a clear emphasis on space stations. Paine was
not pleased "with the level of imagination and the level of
innovation and the level of forward thrust"; he described the
recommendations as "good, workmanlike, but stodgy and
unimaginative."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine reacted quite differently when he
received a briefing from Mueller. Mueller's plan proved easy to sell;
he recalls that he had to "spend more time making sure my facts were
right than convincing Tom." At a June 24 planning review meeting on
June 24, Paine personally directed Newell to accept Mueller's plan
and to use as much of it as possible in preparing NASA's report to
the STG. By then there was not much difference between the two plans;
both featured space stations galore along with lunar stations and a
trip to Mars. Mueller, however, had the more convincing scenario as
to how it might happen, for he made Mars appear to grow out of
ongoing future activity in a natural way. By contrast, Newell made
Mars appear more</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> ad hoc</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">56</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet while Mueller's plan offered exciting
theater, it flew in the face of the demand by the Townes panel for
redress of the imbalance between the piloted and automated elements
of NASA's program. These corresponded respectively to OMSF and OSSA.
With Newell having come out of OSSA to direct his NASA-wide planning
activity, there had been at least a chance that NASA might respond to
Townes' call. When Mueller, head of OMSF, took over the planning with
a set of proposals that grew out of his ties to Bellcomm and STAC, it
was clear that Paine would go to the STG with an agenda that would be
virtually all OMSF. Paine then would learn that there were plenty of
people, in both the Air Force and in the scientific community, who
opposed a [<A NAME="142"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">142</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] single-minded
emphasis on piloted flight, and who certainly were in no hurry to get
to Mars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Robert Seamans was a fellow member of the STG,
co-equal with Paine in standing. His report carried a summary that
rejected virtually all of Mueller's work. He willingly endorsed and
even emphasized the value of a space shuttle:</FONT></P>

let alone several:</FONT></P>

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He had similar hard words about flight to
Mars: "I don't believe we should commit this Nation to a manned
planetary mission, at least until the feasibility and need are more
firmly established." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">57</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lee DuBridge, the third member of the STG,
developed his own view as well. As chairman of the President's
Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), he commissioned a report from the
PSAC's Space Science and Technology Panel. He also issued invitations
to other institutions to present their own positions. The respondees
included the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
(AIAA), the nation's principal professional society in this
field.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The AIAA might readily have done the expected
by acting as a standard Washington lobby, pleasing its corporate
members by asking for the moon. It did no such thing; it issued a
report that was remarkable for its moderation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Flight to Mars? "This program is the next
major step after unmanned exploration of the planets. While it is
technically possible to commit to development of vehicles for this
program at this time, it would not be reasonable to do so."</FONT>

"Again, there has been a constant flow of studies for 10 years of
small and large space stations, most of which assumed that man was to
find an abundance of tasks to perform continually in space." The AIAA
declined to endorse any such proposals, opting instead for additional
activity within Apollo Applications. Its report noted that such
missions "will provide a means of retaining a manned orbital
capability until flight experience produces desirable specifications
for new orbital-station hardware."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">However, concerning space shuttles, the AIAA
had a different view:</FONT></P>

   expendable boosters in delivering medium to large unmanned
   payloads to orbit.... </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We consider
   that commitment to an entirely new space station is less urgent
   than commitment to a new logistics system [emphasis in original].

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of a number of papers that reached the
PSAC, the AIAA report's moderate tone gave it weight. The PSAC also
gave attention to Russell Drew, a staffer at the Office of Science
and Technology. Drew became convinced that the Shuttle was the key
element in the long-range program. In May, the PSAC's Space Science
and Technology Panel met with the full PSAC at Cape Canaveral, with
the Space Shuttle as a prime topic of discussion. Drew wrote a
background paper that emphasized its use in launching automated
spacecraft. Significantly, he downplayed its uses in supporting a
space station.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PSAC report made recommendations that
closely resembled those of Seamans. Seamans had proposed an expansion
of Apollo Applications; the PSAC did so as well, asserting that such
a program could provide much of the data on long-duration human space
flight "for which a more ambitious space station has been proposed."
PSAC rejected such a station, and proposed merely to "keep open the
option of manned planetary exploration in the 1980's, but without
immediate commitment to this goal."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PSAC, however, had kind words for the
Space Shuttle:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is worth noting that PSAC, AIAA, NASA, and
the Air Force all endorsed a shuttle. NASA had developed this concept
for use in space station logistics, but the other three institutions
rejected such a station out of hand. Nevertheless, they liked the
Shuttle because it seemed to promise lower cost and greater
effectiveness in supporting automated spacecraft. This unanimity gave
critical political support to NASA during 1970 and afterward.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In their overall views, however, the members
of the STG were badly split. There was good agreement between the
views of Seamans and of DuBridge, but Paine was far out in the blue
sky. This raised the possibility that DuBridge and Seamans might
collaborate on a majority report, leaving Paine to tack on his views
as an appendix, as Francis Clauser had done with his letter to the
Townes panel. The STG, however, had a fourth member: its chairman,
Spiro Agnew who had been developing his own views as well.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Agnew Leads a Push Toward
Mars</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like many other children of immigrants, Agnew
had advanced in the world largely through his own talent and effort.
On the eve of World War II, he had been a claims adjuster for the
Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company in Baltimore. After returning
from service in the Tenth Armored Division, he became a manager at
Schreiber Food Stores. He acquired a law degree and launched his
political career by winning the presidency of his local PTA. He rose
in politics through the next 20 years, and ran for governor of
Maryland in 1966. It was a time of racial upheaval, and his
Democratic opponent courted the votes of white people with
thinly-disguised racial appeals. Agnew built a reputation as a
moderate, won support among black voters, and took the
election.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He maintained his role as a political
moderate, becoming a leading supporter of Nelson Rockefeller,
governor of New York, who competed with Nixon for the 1968 GOP
presidential nomination. Nixon picked him as his
[<A NAME="145"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">145</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] running mate largely because he had not been around
long enough to draw opposition from any of the party's factions.
Agnew himself admitted that his name was "not a household
word."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He became better known during the campaign due
in part to his personal coarseness. He called Poles "Polacks,"
referred to a Japanese news reporter as "the fat Jap," and declared
that Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic presidential nominee, was "soft
on communism." Campaigning in Detroit-certainly a place where
discretion was advisable-he remarked that "if you've seen one city
slum, you've seen them all." As his reputation spread, protesters
began to greet him with signs such as one that read "Apologize Spiro,
It Will Save Time Later." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">60</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This insensitivity was part of a larger
artlessness, for in dealing with the space program he quickly showed
that despite having no background in this area, he would rush in
where leaders such as Robert Seamans and Lee DuBridge would fear to
tread. At Cape Canaveral, six weeks after the inauguration, he stated
at a luncheon that he was "all-out for space." Less than three weeks
later, at a meeting of the STG, he suggested that Mars could be an
Apollo-like goal for the 1970s. He then raised the prospect of Mars
repeatedly in subsequent discussions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In mid-May, the STG met with members of the
House and Senate who served on the congressional space committee. In
the words of an observer from the Budget Bureau, "a promotional
motive...ran virtually unchecked" at the meeting. Agnew declared that
the nation could "prove its greatness" with the space program. He
added that he "might be all alone," but he "favored a great
achievement represented by planetary travel as a way of invigorating
the American public."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in July, at a meeting with space
planners from outside the government, he stated that "a manned
spaceflight to Mars" could be the "overture to a new era of
civilization." He compared this mission to the early voyages of
exploration: "Would we want to answer through eternity for turning
back a Columbus or a Magellan? Would we be denying the people of the
world the enlightenment and evolution which accompany every great age
of discovery?"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Thus far he had restricted his comments to
audiences at STG meetings. On July 16, however, as he joined
thousands of people at Cape Canaveral for
[<A NAME="146"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">146</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] the liftoff of Apollo 11, he went public. He stated
in an interview that he had the "individual feeling that we should
articulate a simple, ambitious, optimistic goal of a manned flight to
Mars by the end of this century." This statement brought quick
reaction within NASA, as Paine directed his planners to come up with
a "very strong, very far-out, but down-to-earth presentation" that
would "substantially shake up the STG." Specifically, these planners
were to prepare a proposal for a Mars mission at a date well before
1986, a date that Mueller and Newell had previously endorsed in their
planning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mueller's planners at Bellcomm, who had
already devised a concept for a Mars mission based on Mueller's
integrated plan, briefed Paine on their scenario on July 19.
Characteristically, Paine wanted more, and decided to "wheel up
NASA's big gun": Wernher von Braun. He told Von Braun to prepare a
presentation for the STG on the feasibility of a Mars mission that
would resemble Bellcomm's, but that would fly at the earliest
possible date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such studies had been a specialty of the house
at NASA-Marshall, which Von Braun headed. In his words, "it was an
effort of a very few weeks to put a very consistent and good and
plausible story together as to how we would use these new elements to
go to Mars." Paine's directive suited him personally as well, for as
he said a year later, </FONT></P>

   felt that this was the right time. Everyone had listened to
   various proposals. We had listened to everybody; the time had come

   FACE="Geneva">63</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Timing was important in other ways as well,
for the early months of the Nixon Administration coincided with the
brilliant successes of Apollo 8 and Apollo 11. Less than a month
after Apollo 8 had carried the first astronauts to orbit the moon,
Nixon had spoken of them in his inaugural address:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Only a few short weeks ago, we shared

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the Apollo astronauts flew over the
   moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the
   beauty of earth - and in that voice so clear across the lunar
   distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its
   goodness.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In that moment, their view from the
   moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write: "To see the earth as
   it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence
   where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth
   together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal color
   - brothers who know now that they are truly brothers."
   </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">64</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Amid the glow of that triumph, Paine had tried
to win a budget increase and to gain Nixon's support for a space
station. Now in July, the Apollo 11 lunar landing encouraged even
more far-reaching thoughts. In addition to this, the success of
Apollo 11 had the highly practical consequence of freeing up the
first Saturn V for other duty, as Paine committed one of them to
launch the Skylab dry workshop.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">65</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Such broadened
use of the Saturn V would be a keystone of an effort that would aim
at Mars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The members of the STG - Paine, DuBridge,
Seamans, and Agnew - had not held a full-dress meeting since March,
for their staffs had been busy preparing proposals and working
papers. On August 4, however, two weeks after the moon landing, these
principals met anew. Paine declared that "Apollo 11 started a
movement that will never end, a new outward movement in which man
will go to the planets, first to explore, and then to occupy and
[<A NAME="148"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">148</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] utilize them." He then turned the meeting over to Von
Braun, who proceeded to describe a "typical manned Mars
mission."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Carrying 12 astronauts, it would leave Earth
orbit in two spaceships on November 12, 1981. It would arrive in Mars
orbit on August 9, 1982 and would spend 80 days in this orbit, with
six crew members descending to the Martian surface and spending up to
two months exploring it. The expedition would leave Mars late in
October and would swing past Venus four months later. It would arrive
back in Earth orbit on August 14, 1983, ending a flight of 640
days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet despite its boldness, this mission would
rely mostly on the equipment of Mueller's integrated plan. Nuclear
rockets, essential for propulsion, would duplicate Mueller's nuclear
shuttle used for flights between Earth and lunar orbit. The Mars
ships would be variants of a standard space station module. The only
major new item would be a Mars Excursion Vehicle, to carry crews from
orbit to the surface of that planet. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">66</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This proposal left the STG split right down
the middle: Agnew and Paine supporting a strong push toward Mars,
DuBridge and Seamans recommending much less. There was a fifth man at
that meeting: Robert Mayo, director of the Budget Bureau. Though he
was an observer rather than a full member of the STG, his views would
carry weight. His staff had been considering proposals as well. They
emphasized the need not for a single program, but for alternative
programs with budgets at different levels. Mayo now found an ally in
Seamans, who had been highly skeptical of Paine's ambitious
plans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">DuBridge did not emphasize his own point of
view, but tried to encourage a comparison. None was within reach;
indeed, while the STG had hoped to recommend a single program to the
White House, there was no chance it could agree on one. The
disagreements ran deep; Seamans later said he was "sort of like a
skunk at a garden party" for opposing Paine, while Agnew told Mayo
that he was "nothing but a cheapskate." The group still could follow
Mayo's recommendation, which was in line with a standard Washington
practice. Rather than continue to seek the elusive single set of
recommendations, the STG decided to prepare three program options,
which the staffer Russell Drew described:</FONT></P>

   retained.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">2. "Intermediate": Funding increasing
   over the next five years to $5-6 billion per year, with a

   late-1980s.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">3. "Vigorous or all-out": Funding

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This was a major victory for Paine. This
three-option package again reflected standard practice, with the one
in the middle as the one for the President to choose. The other two
choices then would appear as too much and too little. The STG's
"intermediate" program specifically envisioned a commitment to Mars,
with all that would entail: a space shuttle, space station, space
tug, and nuclear shuttle. The only questions would involve the pace,
schedule, and budget.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine, quickly following up this victory with
another, won the assignment of preparing the details of the three
options. This played to a long-established art whereby the officials
chosen to write a White House report can often shape it to suit their
preferences. Rather than provide three different programs, Paine's
staffers proceeded to develop three different schedules for the
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">same</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
plan. That plan took Mueller's integrated scenario as its point of
departure, with all three aiming at a piloted Mars mission sometime
during the 1980s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Plan A offered the "maximum progress
technically feasible." NASA described it as "comparable to the 1961
Apollo decision to go to the moon." Closely resembling the plan that
Paine and Von Braun had presented to the STG on August 4, it called
for a mission to Mars in 1981. Plan B, offering "maximum returns from
an economical program," was the one Paine hoped to have approved; it
differed from Plan A largely in slipping the Mars mission to "1983 or
1986." Plan C offered "minimum investment consistent with continuing
technological advance." It also retained the full Mueller program,
delaying the Mars mission only to 1986 or 1989. The three
alternatives featured dates as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These plans were ready in mid-August. NASA
then added a fourth option, Plan D; it excluded developments related
specifically to the Mars expedition. In other respects it was
identical to Plan C. Plan D, the least ambitious, called for
simultaneous development of a space station and a space shuttle, with
both becoming operational in 1977. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">68</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Significantly, amid the deliberations of the
STG, the members with the most experience - Seamans and DuBridge -
favored the most modest initiatives. Paine, the man for Mars, had
held his posts within NASA for barely a year and a half. Agnew, most
enthusiastic of all, had never dealt with space at any serious level;
he hardly knew a rocket from a sprocket.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The nation had changed since 1961. The
circumstances that had led to Apollo no longer applied. America now
faced new issues and new concerns to such a degree as to make even
the moon landing appear merely as an irrelevant distraction. In no
way would Nixon endorse a mission to Mars. Indeed, within this new
climate, even Plan D would prove to be out of reach.</FONT></P>
