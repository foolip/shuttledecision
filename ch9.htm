"I can remember Nixon coming off a phone conversationwith the astronauts," John Ehrlichman recalls. </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">And you know, they are up on the moon,   and [Nixon was] as high as a kite. He got a big charge out of   them. Then when the astronauts would come to the White House for   dinner afterwards, he would always be enormously stimulated by   contact with these folks. He liked heroes. He thought it was good   for this country to have heroes.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like other presidents before and since, hebasked in the reflected glory of spacefarers. When the crew of Apollo11 returned from the first landing on the moon, he was aboard theaircraft carrier </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">USSHornet</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> to greet them. He then usedthis triumph to gain diplomatic advantage, for after hailing theachievement, he set out on a nine-day world tour that took him tocapitals in Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and Europe.Significantly, he had planned this tour well in advance of the Apollo11 flight, anticipating its safe return. "The President had ratherdaringly pegged his trip to the success of this operation," Tom Painelater remarked. </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Had he gone out to the Pacific to be   present at the splashdown and had there been some kind of an   accident, it might have harmed considerably his ability then to   have the successful trip, which was his first trip abroad as   President.

We just wondered whether he knew the odds   as well as we did. Well, fortunately Apollo 11 was a success, and   in the ensuing world trip, everywhere the President went, the only   thing about the United States that anybody wanted to talk about   was of course the lunar landing.</FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet while Nixon willingly embraced Apollo,which he had inherited from Lyndon Johnson, he took his time incommitting the nation to new initiatives, whether in space or inother areas of technology. Between 1960 and 1980, such civilianinitiatives were largely a province of Democrats: Kennedy and Johnsonwith Apollo and NASA, Jimmy Carter with his ambitious synthetic-fuelsprogram in the late 1970s. When George Shultz presented Nixon withNASA's plan for the space shuttle and urged him to accept it, hedid.</FONT></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon and Technology</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If Nixon had wished to emulate Kennedy bysupporting a new push in space, he could have endorsed the September1969 report of the Space Task Group, with its recommended focus on apiloted mission to Mars. Nixon did no such thing. He did not evenrespond to this report in a timely fashion, waiting nearly six monthsbefore issuing his own statement on space policy. Similarly, thestatement did not come from a senior advisor such as Ehrlichman orHenry Kissinger. Instead, it was the work of two middle-rankingstaffers, William Kriegsman and Clay Whitehead, who reported to PeterFlanigan.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">John Kennedy, while in the White House, hadrepeatedly spoken of space flight with the ring of a clarion call,and it is appropriate to note the contrast. Here is JFK, speaking atRice University in September 1962:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The exploration of space will go ahead   whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great   adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the   leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for   space.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">For the eyes of the world now look into   space-to the moon and to the planets beyond-and we have vowed that   we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by   a banner of freedom and peace.</FONT></I>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="391"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">391</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">We set sail on this new sea because there is new   knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won, and they must be   won and used for the progress of all people.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">But why, some say, the moon?

We   must build on the successes of the past, always reaching out for   new achievements. But we must also recognize that many critical   problems here on this planet make high priority demands on our   attention and our resources. By no means should we allow our space   program to stagnate. But-with the entire future and the entire   universe before us-we should not try to do everything at once. Our   approach to space must continue to be bold-but it must also be   balanced....</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We must realize that space activities   will be a part of our lives for the rest of time. We must think of   them as part of a continuing process-one which will go on day in   and day out, year in and year out-and not as a series of separate   leaps, each requiring a massive concentration of energy and will   and accomplished on a crash timetable.... We must also realize   that space expenditures must take their proper place within a   rigorous system of national priorities.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The statement endorsed the activities thatwere under way at the moment or were well along in preparation:additional Apollo flights, Skylab, planetary[<A NAME="392"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">392</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] missions, and earth-orbiting spacecraft. It calledfor further moves toward international cooperation in space. Itstopped, however, well short of endorsing the Space Shuttle:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We should work to reduce   </FONT></I><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">substantially the cost of   space operations</FONT></I></B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> [emphasis   in original]. Our present rocket technology will provide a   reliable launch capability for some time. But as we build for the   longer-range future, we must devise less costly and less   complicated ways of transporting payloads into space. Such a   capability-designed so that it will be suitable for a wide range   of scientific, defense and commercial uses-can help us realize   important economies in all aspects of our space program. We are   currently examining in greater detail the feasibility of re-usable   space shuttles as one way of achieving this objective.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This paragraph amounted to a Nixonian blessingfor the continued "examining" that would proceed during the next twoyears. The overall statement, however, endorsed only one newinitiative: "Grand Tour," a program that would take advantage of arare alignment of the outer planets to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,and Neptune. Moreover, Nixon's statement specifically supported hisbudget for FY 1971, which continued a policy of cuts inappropriations that dated to 1966. In 1970, NASA was still inretreat, and this statement underscored this march to the rear.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet amid this retreat, Nixon maintained strongsupport for his existing program, with the SST being a prime example.In Ehrlichman's words, </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon died very hard on the SST, and he   had a commitment to that which had to do with chauvinism, I think,   is the proper word. We had to be at the leading edge of this kind   of applied technological development. And if we weren't, then a   great deal of national virtue was lost, and our standing in the   world and all that. He was terribly troubled to go to an   international conference and have the French president arrive in   an SST. That was why that was very hard on him.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In an attempt to recoup, Nixon borrowed anidea of the Democrats: that the government should use the resourcesof aerospace to solve domestic [<A NAME="393"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">393</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] problems. Duringthe second half of 1971, several of his senior advisors tried tolaunch an effort called the New Technology Opportunities Program(NTOP), which sought to define specific projects that might be ripefor federal support. The key man in this effort, William Magruder,had been Nixon's head of the SST program. Ehrlichman recalls thatNixon gave an instruction: "Let's keep in science and technology, andlet's find something good for Magruder to do." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The activity began on July 1, when Ehrlichmansent letters to 15 agencies, asking for proposals. The responses wentto the Office of Science and Technology, where Edward David's staffcarried out initial evaluations. Then in September, Nixon bypassedDavid as head of this program, even though David had come up withinBell Labs as a technologist, and even though his purview specificallyincluded technology. In an action that effectively downgraded thisside of David's domain, Nixon named Magruder as head of NTOP. The OSTstaff continued its assessments, but Magruder broadened the review toinclude people from the Treasury Department and the Council ofEconomic Advisers. Magruder also worked with the OMB's Donald Rice,who assigned a staff member, Hugh Loweth, to work full-time onbudgetary aspects.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The effort went forward under tight deadlines,for Ehrlichman wanted to have a finished set of proposals in hand bythe end of 1971, in time for inclusion in the FY 1973 budget and thePresident's State of the Union message. Magruder expanded his reachby seeking ideas from private industry, sending out hundreds ofletters to corporations and trade associations. "We were continuallyin a crisis situation," said one OST manager. "Toward the end, wewere killing those guys in the OMB, hitting them with more and moreproposals every day. Poor Hugh Loweth was working practically a24-hour day."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The reviewers quickly discovered, however,that the prospective domestic initiatives carried difficulties thatranged well beyond the merely technical. One important proposalcalled for full-scale development of high-speed rail transportationin the Northeast, laying new rail and refurbishing passengerstations. The New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, recentlymerged into the Penn Central, had allowed this service to deterioratebadly; the Penn Central had gone bankrupt in 1970. Yet its tracks andrights-of-way were still serviceable.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva"> 5</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="394"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">394</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] "We pushed thatpretty hard," said Lawrence Goldmuntz, who directed the OST'sproposal evaluations. </FONT></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">And who can argue that it shouldn't be   a high-priority item? But in analyzing that proposal the White   House also had to take into account the fact that there are   several thousand government jurisdictions involved, that the Penn   Central is not the most popular railroad in the country today,   that it might get athwart union work rules-and well, a number of   complicated issues like this came up.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another proposal envisioned the development oftwo-way television, which would foreshadow today's personal computerswith e-mail. Two-way TV would allow individual citizens tocommunicate directly with city social-service agencies, includinghealth, welfare, and police-protection programs. "But we quickly gotcaught in a crossfire between the Corporation for PublicBroadcasting, the Office of Telecommunications Policy, and the cableTV interests," said Goldmuntz. "The policy questions were just toocomplex."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another concept promised to develop integratedutilities, which would combine sewage and solid-waste disposal,power, heat, and light within a single system. Such systems, built asmodules, offered major savings through lower fuel consumption, withthe modules being installed in office towers and apartment buildings.Such integrated services, however, would have raised opposition fromunionized municipal workers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other proposals ran afoul of recent changes inthe national mood. The Atomic Energy Commission had a long-runninginterest in peaceful uses of nuclear explosives. Its officialsendorsed a demonstration project that would use multiple detonationsto fracture impermeable rock formations that held natural gas. Theconcept gained high marks from Magruder's reviewers; the AEC planeven seemed to promise commercial feasibility. However, 1972 was anelection year, and with environmentalists showing their strength, theAdministration could not touch it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Still other proposals faced politicalopposition, such as a plan to build offshore terminals for deep-draftsupertankers that drew too much water to enter conventional ports.Such terminals promised to cut shipping costs by eliminating the needto route the supertankers to the Caribbean, where they would transfertheir cargoes of oil to smaller tankers of lesser draft. Thisproposal, [<A NAME="395"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">395</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] however, facedstrong opposition from governors of states in the Northeast, whofeared oil spills. It also would have tended to push the White Housetoward endorsing expansion of oil imports, a policy that Nixon wasreluctant to support.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Four senior White House officials carried outthe final review: John Ehrlichman, head of the Domestic Council; OMBdirector George Shultz; Peter Flanigan, special assistant to thePresident; and Peter Peterson, director of the Council onInternational Economic Policy. They declined to endorse any ofMagruder's proposals, and the main reason was that in the course ofthe NTOP exercise, key people had come to realize that they trulyknew little about the process of technological innovation. ByChristmas, NTOP was moribund.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We did think in the summer that we could domore and do it quickly," said Peterson. "By December, we weredetermined to go slow and keep our feet on the ground. I didn't thinkwe should jump into anything before we knew where we were going."Edward David added that "one of the things many of us had driven homemore clearly than before was that R and D is not the wholestory-you've got to take into account customs, mores, politics,existing structures, and a whole host of other things when you attacka technological issue." Raymond Bisplinghoff, deputy director of theNational Science Foundation, concluded that this exercise "verifiedthat we do not know how to make major interventions by the federalgovernment in the R and D sector."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is a matter of record that as the NTOPfell, the Space Shuttle rose and won Nixon's approval. The latterevent, however, did not follow from the former. Edwin Harper,assistant director of the Domestic Council, told </FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">National Journal</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, "I wasat all the relevant meetings and the two programs were neverdiscussed in terms of a trade-off. The timing of the space-shuttledecision had an independent history." Both NTOP and the shuttle hadto stand on their respective merits; in the end, only the Shuttlesurvived the cut.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NTOP nevertheless was important, for itrepresented a serious White House attempt to redirect the resourcesof aerospace toward new domestic priorities. When the attemptfaltered, it soon became clear that Nixon would not try to help thebeleaguered aerospace industry by having its people work on masstransit or pollution control. Instead, he would give them anelection-year gift by keeping that industry's resources within therealm of aerospace.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="396"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">396</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><B><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">Space Shuttle: The Last Moves</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In mid-November, three weeks after theDirector's Review and three weeks before the OMB would requestNixon's approval for a downsized Shuttle, Low wrote: "The shuttleconfiguration is beginning to be focused on a considerably smallerorbiter with external hydrogen and oxygen tanks (but with the samepayload size and weight) and with a pressure-fed recoverable boosterwhich might be parallel staged." The use of a pressure-fed boosterwas an option dating to the studies of early summer; the possibilityof parallel staging, with booster and orbiter engines all burning atliftoff, showed the influence of TAOS. On November 22, in his reportto Rice, Low was more definite: "The most promising candidateconfiguration today is the Mark I/Mark II orbiter with theparallel-staged pressure-fed booster."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ten days later, the OMB's Memorandum for thePresident acknowledged NASA's recent design revisions but called onthe agency to accept a version of the shuttle that would be lesscostly still:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Last year NASA was proposing a $10-12 B   Shuttle. In response to questions from OMB and OST about whether   the benefits justified such a large investment, NASA has since   designed a $6 B Shuttle which can do all the missions of the   larger, more expensive one because it has exactly the same payload   capability. (We think both costs are underestimated, perhaps by   50%, i.e., cost overruns are likely on both but more likely on the   more expensive version.)</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In either case, NASA would plan to   replace all of the U.S. expendable booster programs with the   Shuttle. Thus, one program, the Shuttle, would dominate NASA for   the coming decade, as did Apollo in the 1960's. This would make   efforts to reorient NASA to domestic pursuits more difficult, and   tend to starve unmanned earth applications missions for   resources.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Shuttle alternative that is chosen   must balance costs, benefits and subjective   considerations.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">What are the Options?

With its 10 x 30-foot payloadbay and 30,000-pound capacity, the OMB Shuttle would still capturesome 80 percent of the payloads of the larger designs. Similarly, theOMB would not permit its shuttle to be all things to all people; itsmemo to Nixon stated that "for national security purposes, we may notwant all our eggs in one basket." The OMB stated explicitly that the[<A NAME="400"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">400</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] nation was to "retain the reliable Titan IIIexpendable booster to launch the few largest payloads that would notfit the smaller Shuttle. These include space telescopes and largeintelligence satellites." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon took about a week before he read andaccepted the OMB memo. On Saturday, December 11, Fletcher and Low metwith Rice, David, and Flanigan. These NASA officials learned thatNixon indeed had decided to go ahead with the shuttle-provided thatit was the downsized version of the OMB. This brought considerableand heated discussion. Fletcher finally declared that he could notaccept such a decision, and that he wanted to see the President. Thismeeting did not take place, for Fletcher subsequently decided that hewould not help his cause by staging a confrontation withNixon.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher nevertheless would fight for a largerShuttle, and in doing this, he would stand for NASA in the fashion ofhis predecessors. Paine had been the visionary, pushing toward Mars.Low had succeeded Paine; as Acting Administrator, he pushed stronglyfor two-stage fully-reusable designs. He also sought OMB approval toinitiate Shuttle development during FY 1972, and won permission toproceed with the SSME on such a schedule. By contrast, Fletcher hadacquiesced to OMB pressure from the outset, abandoning the high-costalternatives as he struggled to meet the OMB's stringent cost limits.He still had a limited amount of wiggle room, and he would make themost of it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the OMB memo to Nixon specified adevelopment cost, it did not state a payload size or capacity. TheOMB presented its numbers separately in a paper for NASA: 10 x 30feet, 30,000 pounds. Low responded quickly; on Monday, December 13,he sent a memo to Dale Myers that asked for an in-house assessment ofthis OMB shuttle, to be completed by the end of the month. In thisassessment, Myers was to try once more for the full-capacity Shuttleof 15 x 60 feet and 65,000 pounds, by comparing its merits with thoseof the OMB's configuration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Flanigan also proved helpful, as he sent amemo to Fletcher from the White House: "None of the figures in thepaper given to you are set in concrete. Rather, they should be viewedas a new way to approach the problem, against which an initialestimate will be made within a couple of weeks. Obviously,[<A NAME="401"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">401</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] those figures will have to be refined in succeedingweeks." He added pointedly, "There is no written directive from thePresident on this subject." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher, however, had to prepare once againto give ground. The OMB was willing to permit NASA to build itsshuttle with the SSME; it was willing to bypass the interim Phase Iorbiter with its J-2S engines. The OMB also would allow a booster "ofthe reusable pressure-fed type," which Low had recommended.Nevertheless, while rejecting the OMB's small payload size andweight, Fletcher and Low had to find new ways to save money and tocut the developmental cost anew.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With OMB ready to toss the Air Force's payloadbay out the window, and with the OMB calling for continued use of theTitan III for large Air Force payloads, it was appropriate to take afresh look at another Air Force requirement, which had demanded acrossrange of 1100 nautical miles. This had been a prime reason forthe choice of a delta wing for the orbiter, which drove up the weightof the Shuttle and increased its cost by requiring more thermalprotection. With the OMB now pressing NASA to return to the payloadcapacity recommended by Max Faget, the agency had to consider whetherit might cut costs by also returning to Faget's straight-wing orbiterdesign.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Charles Donlan, acting director of the Shuttleprogram office, ruled this out. In a memo to Low, he emphasized thathigh crossrange would be "fundamental to the operation of theorbiter." It would make the Shuttle maneuverable, greatly broadeningthe opportunities to abort a mission and perhaps save the lives ofastronauts. A high crossrange would also afford frequentopportunities to return to Cape Canaveral in the course of a normalmission, following launch from that site.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Delta wings also promised advantages that wereentirely separate from crossrange. A delta orbiter would be stable inflight from hypersonic to subsonic speeds, throughout a wide range ofnose-high attitudes. The aerodynamic flow over such an orbiter wouldbe smooth and predictable, with the delta wing thus permittingaccurate predictions of heating during reentry and giving confidencein the design of the thermal protection system. In addition to this,the delta vehicle would experience relatively low temperatures of 600to 800 &#176;F over its sides and upper surfaces.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="402"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">402</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] By contrast,straight-wing configurations would produce complex hypersonic flowfields, with high local temperatures and severe changes intemperature on the wing, body and tail. Temperatures on the sides ofthe fuselage would run from 900 to 1300 degrees, making the analysisand design of thermal protection more complex. During transition fromsupersonic to subsonic speeds, the straight-wing orbiter wouldexperience unsteady flow and buffeting, making it harder tofly.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because of this combination of aerodynamic andoperational advantages, Donlan favored the delta wing for reasonsthat were entirely separate from those of the Air Force. Fletcher,however, still could back off on the issue of payload-bay capacity. Asmaller bay would give a smaller and somewhat less costly orbiter.Reducing the payload weight would trim the size and mass of theentire Shuttle, cutting costs even further. Moreover, for the pastseveral weeks Fletcher had been holding in reserve the possibility ofsuch cuts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He had gone to lunch on October 19 with DavidPackard, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Packard had stated thathe felt very uneasy over the Air Force's design requirements for theshuttle. As Fletcher wrote in a memo to Low,</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The requirements which he was   particularly concerned about were the cross-range requirement, and   payload requirement, and the size requirement. He felt that the   cross-range requirement might have been an artificial one and   although he didn't fully understand the implications of it felt   that if it were causing difficulties, it could easily be modified.   I assured him that the diameter requirement came primarily from   NASA and not from the Air Force, but that the length probably came   from the Air Force. He knew quite well which program caused the   length difficulty and although it can't be discussed in this   memorandum, it is clear to both of us that something could be done   in this regard also. We both agreed that the payload requirement   was somewhat arbitrary at this point.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher did not discuss this with Rice orWeinberger, for he was about to engage them in the high-stakes gamethat followed the Director's Review, and he did not want to tip hishand. Two months later, however, with Fletcher preparing to play thiscard of Shuttle capacity, Low's memo of December 13 directed Myers tocompare four cases: the OMB Shuttle, the full-size NASA[<A NAME="403"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">403</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] shuttle, a design of 12 x 40 feet and 30,000 poundsthat NASA had studied previously, and a new case of 14 x 50 feet and65,000 pounds. They all knew, however, that they could not start witha smaller bay and then enlarge it. Donlan had written that such acourse "is not considered practical. The most cost effective systemis one sized properly at the outset for its intended use."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, with Low presenting newalternatives to the NASA staff for evaluation, Don Rice found himselfin a position to add a few alternatives of his own. He had formalchannels for receiving information from NASA, but now he opened upsome back-channels that gave him access to additional sources. "Someof my information came from the Defense Department, but not very muchof it," he later remarked. "Some of it came from industry. There wereclearly some people in industry who were concerned that NASA wasgoing to lead them down the road of another C-5A debacle and thatthey would end up with nothing."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher saw what was happening: </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">He would come up with his own drawings   on what it should look like. He had private sources that he was   turning to. Contractors wanting their particular version.   Contractors do that. And there is no reason why they shouldn't. I   hate to say this about Don but he really didn't understand   aerospace contractors. Tell him to design a cheaper system, he'd   design a cheaper system. He went that far; he came up with his own   design.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher took it in stride: "We kept dealingwith him. After all, you have to be polite, because you never knowwho's going to be your boss next." Low also joined in the exchanges.At one point, Rice presented a developmental cost of $4 billion andclaimed that it came from a contractor whose name he could notdivulge. Low asked him to disclose the contractor, so that NASA couldcritique his claim. Rice refused, but based on the questions he hadasked, Low concluded that the contractor was North American Rockwell.That company had given far more information to NASA than to Rice, andLow determined that Rice's $4 billion left out company profit and thecost of NASA program support. Indeed, it was the equivalent ofnumbers that NASA itself had shown.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="404"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">404</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Every time Rice gota bright idea, he would send it over to NASA for assessment by itsstaff. The OMB's William Niskanen, head of its Evaluation Division,chimed in with similar requests of his own. Within NASA, WilliamLilly was the chief budget officer and was close to the working levelwhere people had to take the time to deal with these matters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lilly tried to come between Rice and hisstaff: </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was some dirty warfare going on at   that time. Our approach was to, in essence, to create doubt in   their boss's mind of the value of the work they had done. We did   our studies and in many ways in order just to prove that they were   biased, and they were wrong and they didn't know what they were   doing. And any way we could embarrass them, we did it.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lilly took care to control the flow ofinformation from NASA to the OMB, for he knew that a small leak cansink a great ship: </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I reached the point, to hell with you,   back of my hand to you. I mean, you can't do your job if I don't   let you in the Agency. And in essence, I probably went about   shutting them off from information throughout the Agency. I just   told my people that, in a way that they understood, but not really   telling them, they weren't to respond. I wanted to see everything   that went over. There was to be no answers to questions given   throughout the Agency to OMB without it coming through me   personally.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"They kept throwing road blocks on us," Lillycontinues. "Every time we would come up with a study and do what theywanted in terms of comparative analysis. They couldn't challenge whatwe had done in many ways, they would turn around and come withstudying a new concept." In time, Niskanen sent a request that wenttoo far: "To be brutally frank about it, the reaction we had or myattitude on it, and what, in essence, I told them? I told them to goshove it up your ass. I wasn't going to do any such thing. It didn'tmake any goddamn sense. I wasn't about to do such a study, and wenever did."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher, by then, was using channels of hisown: "We were kind of mean to Don in going over his head all thetime. But I figured that was the only way we could get this thingdone." He met with Caspar Weinberger "quite[<A NAME="405"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">405</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] frequently," with Peter Flanigan "almost as often,"and with George Shultz "two or three times." He also arranged ameeting with John Ehrlichman. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These exchanges continued through Christmas.On Monday, December 27, having reviewed the latest contractorstudies, Fletcher prepared to play his poker card of Shuttle capacityand to make an offer that would counter the OMB Shuttle of two weeksearlier. "We met all day to discuss the various options," Low wrote.Low continued those meetings on Tuesday morning, talking with Myers,with Lilly, and with others as well. Following those meetings, Lowand Fletcher agreed on the terms of their counteroffer. Fletcher thenpresented these terms to Weinberger in a December 29 letter:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We have concluded that the full   capability 15 x 60' - 65,000# shuttle still represents a "best   buy", and in ordinary times should be developed.

Case 1 was the OMB shuttle; Case 4 was the ShuttleNASA wanted and now apparently would not have. Following standardcustom, the option Fletcher proposed was right in the middle as Case2A. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher privately knew that he could go stilllower. Talking with Low, he decided that they could accept somethingas small as 14 x 40 feet with 40,000 pounds. The two men then went toan afternoon meeting with White House and OMB officials: Shultz,Weinberger, Flanigan, David, Rice and Rose. Shultz was now the keyman; he headed the OMB, he was Rice's boss, and he had Nixon'sear.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Shultz looked at NASA's presentation anddecided that the only thing that made any sense, as NASA had said allalong, would be the full-size version, Case 4. Shultz, however, didnot press this point for Rice objected vigorously. Rice's staff wasstill active; only one day earlier, his economist John Sullivan hadsent him a memo arguing anew that the most cost-effective system wasstill the Titan III. The meeting broke up with no decision. Fletcherand Low, however, came away fairly confident that they would at leastget Case 2A, which they had recommended. Indeed, Shultz's support,however tentative, allowed them to hope that they might even win thefull-capability Case 4.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rice again prevailed, as he talked furtherwith Weinberger. In a phone conversation with Fletcher, Weinbergerstated that he wanted NASA to look at a 14 x 45-foot Shuttle-with30,000 pounds of payload, only two-thirds that of Case 2A. In Low'swords, "Fletcher came close to telling Weinberger to go to hell butrestrained himself perhaps better than I could." Fletcher then phonedShultz and talked with him at length. Shultz remained unwilling tomake a decision, but recommended that NASA should take one more lookat Rice's request.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although Rice was holding firm on a weight of30,000 pounds, he now was willing to budge slightly on payload size,for Sullivan's memo had discussed a 12 x 40-foot shuttle with twinsolid boosters. Though this configuration would carry no more weightthan a Titan III, it could fly with the boosters of a Titan III:120-inch solid motors that were in production and had known costs.Such a Shuttle still would not match the cost-effectiveness of theTitan III itself, but it would come close. In Sullivan's ownanalysis, that [<A NAME="407"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">407</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Titan would saveonly $100 million when compared to that Shuttle. Within the OMB, thiswas as near to an endorsement as any type of shuttle was likely toreceive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Low phoned Rice and asked him to put hisquestions in writing. Rice replied that he might have furtherquestions subsequently, but he drew up a set of queries and sent itover to Low late on Friday evening, which was New Year's Eve. Lowdiscussed them with Fletcher and Myers over the weekend; on Monday,January 3, they completed their response.

It quickly developed that some of thespecialists in Houston had misread some key tables of data.

So Shultz said, 'Well, what are you   fooling around with that 45-foot configuration for? It doesn't   cost that much more. Why don't you get the one you want-take the   60-foot one.' And Fletcher came back with that message.

So when it was   clear that all the boys made their case, Shultz said, 'If we're   going to do it, let's do it right; let's do the big shuttle and   forget about the Bureau of the Budget shuttle.'

Similarly, the views of Rice and Davidwould carry no weight. Shultz, after all, was Rice's boss, and it wasShultz who would meet with Nixon. David also reported to Nixon, buthe had little clout.

In turn, Anders' statement formed the bulk of the materialused in Nixon's.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As recently as November, Flanigan hadanticipated that any White House announcement would be low-key. Atthat time, with the $3 billion glider as the likely new initiative,Flanigan expected to see the main coverage limited to the aerospacetrade press, thereby reassuring this industry of Nixon's supportwhile avoiding the high visibility that would draw fire from critics.The Shuttle, however, had metamorphosed now into a $5.5 billionprogram. As early as the previous Friday, prior to the meeting inShultz's office, a White House staffer had already laid out thehigh-profile announcement that now was scheduled for Wednesday,January 5.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher and Low flew out to California,editing two NASA statements along the way. Nixon greeted them at theWestern White House, as did John [<A NAME="412"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">412</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Ehrlichman. Thoughthe President had planned to spend only 15 minutes with his visitors,the meeting ran well beyond a half-hour as he showed strong interestin the Shuttle and the space program. Fletcher had brought a model ofa TAOS, and Ehrlichman would remember "Nixon's fascination with themodel. And he held it and, in fact, I wasn't sure that Fletcher wasgoing to be able to get it away from him when the thing wasover."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon stated that NASA should stress civilianapplications but should not hesitate to note the military uses aswell. He showed interest in the possibility of routine operations andquick reaction times, for he saw that these could allow the Shuttleto help in disasters such as earthquakes or floods. He also liked theidea of using the Shuttle to dispose of nuclear waste by launching itinto space. Fletcher mentioned that it might become possible tocollect solar power in orbit and beam it to earth in the form ofelectricity. Nixon replied that such developments tend to happen muchmore quickly than people expect, and that they should not hesitate totalk about them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He liked the fact that ordinary people wouldbe able to fly in the Shuttle, who would not be highly-trainedastronauts. He asked if the Shuttle was a good investment, and agreedthat it was indeed, for it promised a tenfold reduction in the costof space flight. He added that even if it was not a good investment,the nation would have to do it anyway, because space flight was hereto stay. Fletcher came away from the meeting saying, "The Presidentthinks about space just like McCurdy does," referring to a colleaguewithin NASA's upper management.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although his formal statement largelyreflected NASA's views, Nixon edited the draft in his own hand. Thefinal version showed a firmness and sense of direction that had beenutterly lacking in his March 1970 statement on space policy. It alsofeatured a grace note that might have suited John Kennedy:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I have decided today that the United   States should proceed at once with the development of an entirely   new type of space transportation system designed to help transform   the space frontier of the 1970s into familiar territory, easily   accessible for human endeavor in the 1980s and '90s.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">This system will center on a space   vehicle that can shuttle repeatedly from earth to orbit and back.   It will revolutionize transportation into near space, by   routinizing it.

Fletcher, Shapley, and Low had prepareda list that included Pegasus, Hermes, Astroplane, and Skylark.Flanigan passed this list to White House staffers, who picked thename Space Clipper. A draft of Nixon's statement used this name,which resembled Lockheed's Star-Clipper. Nixon himself, however,decided that it would be better to refer to the vehicle in the usualfashion, as the "Space Shuttle." Earlier piloted spacecraft hadcarried names such as Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo, but the new onewould break with this practice.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Criticism of Nixon's decision came from theusual sources, with Senator Proxmire issuing a press release: "ThePresident has clearly reordered our priorities. But he has reorderedthem the wrong way." Senator William Fulbright played the same note:"I believe the shuttle simply cannot rank high on our list ofpriorities in view of the critical social and economic problems weface." They, however, were merely outriders within a Democratic Partythat had long commanded the center of American politics but now wasslipping to the left, and whose presidential candidate, GeorgeMcGovern, would shortly receive one of the worst electoral drubbingsever administered. Though Congress would perform its constitutionalrole by voting the funding, it would not become an important sourceof opposition.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="414"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">414</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Certainly there waspolitics aplenty in Nixon's decision. He wanted to help the aerospaceindustry during the upcoming election year, and the staffer JonathanRose, reporting to Flanigan, had been monitoring that industry'sunemployment. Fletcher, in a letter to Rose of November 22, hadwritten that an early start on the Shuttle "would lead to a directemployment of 8,800 by the end of 1972, and 24,000 by the end of1973." Ehrlichman would recall that this was </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">a very important consideration in   Nixon's mind. There are what we call battleground states; they are   the pivotal states that control big blocks of electoral votes. So   when you look at unemployment numbers, and you key them to the   battleground states, the space program has an importance out of   proportion to its budget.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The politics also reached a much higher level,touching the matter of presidential decisions that could stand as alegacy, with consequences that would reverberate through comingdecades. Theodore White, a chronicler of presidents, had written in1965 that "on the far edge of the plateau lie problems which we inthis decade cannot conceive of as political." These included "themoon and space. How large a part of American energy should beinvested in this exploration with no definable certainty except thecertainty that it will change the lives of all our children?"</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Weinberger had made an important point in hismemo to Nixon of August 12: the United States, as the world's greatreserve of strength, could do more than merely add bricks to thewelfare state. Such policies might suit the British, of whom theformer secretary of state Dean Acheson had said, "Great Britain haslost an Empire and has not yet found a role." They would not suitAmerica.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One could view Nixon's decision as astraightforward exercise in daily work at the White House. Nixon hada strong interest in management; he had set up a staff system, whichincluded a strengthened OMB, that could weigh policy alternativeswith considerable effectiveness and present him with well-researchedoptions for his decision. As one Flax Committee staffer put it, "Oncethey decided to do it, Nixon and Ehrlichman weren't going to arguewith NASA whether it ought to be a 60 or a 45-foot-long bay, or 12 or15 feet. If the head of NASA is telling them that it has to be thissize and they want to go ahead with the project, they are going tosay go ahead." The demise of [<A NAME="415"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">415</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] NTOP also helped.While the Shuttle stood on its merits and did not simply replace NTOPas a backup, Nixon and Shultz had been prepared to include fundingfor NTOP initiatives in the FY 1973 budget. When no suitableproposals came forth, that made it easier to shift the putative NTOPfunds over to the Shuttle, and to approve a larger Shuttle aswell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet while the Shuttle could not match thesignificance of Nixon's opening to China, it drew on more than goodstaff work. In Ehrlichman's words, "There wasn't anybody who madethose final decisions except Nixon, in this kind of area. Defense,space, certain kinds of domestic problems-he was the final arbiter."The Shuttle carried Nixon's personal stamp because it carried hispersonal decision. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Loose Ends I: A FinalConfiguration</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now that Shultz had handed NASA its Shuttle ona silver platter, the agency had to decide how it would look. Thequestion of choosing a booster was still up in the air, and it wasfar from clear that the Shuttle indeed would be a TAOS; liquid-fueledboosters designed as conventional first stages were making a strongcomeback. Similarly, the agency could not simply walk away fromFletcher's alternative of 14 x 45 feet and 45,000 pounds; NASA itselfhad proposed it, and it merited additional attention because itoffered the potential advantage of being able to use existing120-inch solid rocket motors. Further study of this design would alsodiscourage the OMB from complaining that NASA once again wasabandoning a good possibility with unseemly haste.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the issue of payload size and weightwas still open, the basic design of the orbiter was approaching adefinitive form. During the fall of 1971, when the Mark I/Mark IIapproach was still in the forefront, the contractors had worked froma Max Faget configuration known as MSC-040A. It elaborated theearlier MSC-040 by adding small liquid-fuel engines for orbitalmaneuvers, along with thrusters for attitude control that weremounted at the tips of the wings and tail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Mark I/Mark II concept, however, with itsphased technology, had never been more than an artificial stratagemto reduce peak funding by stretching[<A NAME="416"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">416</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] out the development, while accepting seriouscompromises in design. With Shultz's support, NASA now was free tobuild an honest orbiter, one that would be right the first time.MSC-040A had called for four J-2S engines; a variant of January 1972,MSC-040C, replaced them with three SSMEs.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other decisions shaped the orbiter's structureand thermal protection. Though hot structures now looked like an openinvitation to a cost overrun, everyone knew how to build an aluminumairplane, and the orbiter indeed would take shape as an aircraftbuilt largely of this metal. It, however, still needed thermalprotection, and NASA now placed its hope in the still-unproven tiles.Though recent research had increased confidence that they indeedwould serve, what made tiles more attractive yet was that NASA couldcount with reasonable assurance on using ablative heat shields as abackup. Ongoing work with ablatives had cut their cost dramaticallywhile reducing their weight to 15 pounds per square foot, matchingthe weight of the tiles. A year later, Eugene Love, a director atNASA-Langley, would write, "Ablators are baselined as a confidentfall-back solution (temporary) for both leading edges and largesurface areas, should development of the baseline approaches lag."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the choice of booster was stillunsettled, during the early weeks of 1972 there was excellent reasonto believe that NASA's eventual selection would take good care of theMarshall Space Flight Center. The winged S-IC would have donesplendidly, but even Boeing, which had built the basic S-IC and knewthis concept best, had been unable to drive its development cost lowenough to compete with alternatives such as TAOS. It fell by thewayside around the end of 1971, amid criticism even within theShuttle community. John Yardley, who headed the work at McDonnellDouglas, told </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">AviationWeek</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, "You just could not build theworld's largest airplane without all the problems that would go witha 700,000-pound craft. And it doesn't buy you much flying it back ifyou can do the same job in a cheaper way."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Boeing and NASA-Marshall, however, would notbe denied, as they proposed a new alternative: a pump-fed booster.Though this again was to be an S-IC variant, it would be withoutwings, tail, jet engines, landing gear, or crew compartment. Insteadit amounted to the standard S-IC, fitted out to land in the ocean byusing parachutes. A retro-rocket was to cushion its impact in the[<A NAME="417"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">417</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] sea; it then would float like a ditched airplane asit awaited rescue. After refurbishment, it would fly again.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">TAOS concepts were still very much in therunning, with solid motors receiving a share of attention. Theliquid-fueled TAOS, however, with twin pressure-fed boosters flankingthe external tank, had lost favor. A key group of Shuttle designreviewers, at the Manned Spacecraft Center, had come around insteadto recommending a single pressure-fed booster that would take theform of a conventional first stage. This, too, would provide gristfor the mill of NASA-Marshall, for that center would managedevelopment of both the booster and its engines.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the OMB, Daniel Taft, who worked withthe NASA budget, saw an opportunity-and smelled a rat. Theopportunity existed because NASA's own estimates proposed that asuitable solid rocket motor would cost up to a billion dollars lessto develop than a pressure-fed booster. In addition to this, the AirForce had already developed the 120-inch solids of the Titan III,thus providing a base of experience along with confidence in thevalidity of the new cost estimates for solids. Pressure-fed versionscarried no such experience and no such confidence, for they had neverbeen built before.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA, however, wanted a pressure-fed booster,and Taft knew that to lead it to solids would not be easy. In a memoto Rice, late in January, he laid out the issues. He wrote that"NASA's schedule for the selection of the final configuration...isextremely tight (March 1)." Drawing on Rice's back-channels to thecontractors, Taft noted that one such source had recommended thatpressure-fed designs should be studied for six to twelve months. Taftalso asked "whether NASA can overcome its instinctive dislike" ofsolid rocket motors. He added:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA has recently let contracts with   the four major solid rocket contractors ($150 K each) for quick (1   month) studies of development and production costs and technical   aspects of SRMs. This is truly a hasty last minute effort by NASA   which can hardly be expected to make up for NASA's failure to   study SRMs seriously in the past.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Of course, the requirement for   Marshall's involvement in the shuttle program would be quite weak   if SRMs were selected.

Nixon's message to Congress included NASA's full amount of$228 million for the Shuttle: $200 million for the program per se,$28 million for construction of facilities. NASA's FY 1973 requesttotaled $3.379 billion in new obligational authority, $3.192 billionin outlays. In a letter to Fletcher dated February 9, Weinberger,however, emphasized that the second of these numbers was the one thatcounted: "For planning purposes an annual spending level of $3.2billion should be assumed for the foreseeable future"-that is,through FY 1978. A week later, Shultz repeated this and added, "Wealso fully expect NASA to develop a shuttle system within the $5.5billion estimate." The billion-dollar difference in developmentcosts, pressure-fed versus solid, came to nearly one-fifth of thistotal. Choosing solids thus would give much needed leeway.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the subsequent week, contractorspresented briefings and gave their recommendations concerning thechoice of booster. Low wrote that these briefings "yielded therecommendations for each contractor that were most predictable basedon vested interests." They also were predictable based on thecontractors' choices during a similar exercise six months earlier,when they had compared expendable boosters for interim use. On boththese occasions, Boeing's recommendations had been particularlyegregious.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Boeing was home to the S-IC and was teamedwith Grumman. In their report of September 1, they had proposed thatthe standard S-IC, which needed no development, would give lowercosts in an interim program of up [<A NAME="419"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">419</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] to 30 shuttleflights. (Boeing had built only 15 S-ICs for the whole of Apollo.)Now, in February, Boeing continued to root for the home team bycoming out in favor of its pump-fed booster. This report also cameout strongly against solid rockets, urging that they "should beeliminated from further consideration."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By contrast, Lockheed was a major builder ofsolids. In September, it merely had weighed the merits of competingsizes and arrangements of solids, drawing on this in-house expertise.Now, however, it compared a range of alternatives that includedliquid boosters-and found again that solids were best. The Februarybriefing from North American Rockwell was also in character. InSeptember, that company had found no reason to choose between thealternatives of the day. Now it hedged anew, stating that one couldchoose either solids or a conventional liquid first stage, dependingon what cost goals were most important.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">McDonnell Douglas also liked solids. Itcertainly had long experience with liquids, having built the Thormissile, the Delta launch vehicle, and the S-IVB, the third stage ofthe Saturn V. It also was familiar with solids, being accustomed touse them to provide the widely-used Delta with extra boost at launch.It had endorsed solids in September; it now did so again. In additionto this, its report carried a lengthy review of their safety.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The review covered 2128 solid-motor firings,as Delta strap-ons, Titan III boosters, Minuteman ICBMs, and thesmall four-stage Scout. Thirteen had failed, in ways that werepertinent to the Shuttle, and McDonnell Douglas took care to noteboth the causes of the failures and the changes in design or inquality-control procedures that could prevent them from recurring.The report noted particularly that in the event of such recurrences,it would usually be possible to safely abort a Shuttle launch.However, there was an exception.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This would happen if the hot, high-pressuregas within a solid motor succeeded in burning through its casing.Large solids were built in segments, pinned together at their joints,and such joints posed particular hazard of a burnthrough.

This removed the last questionsas to whether NASA would get the full-size version that it wanted.But with the booster recommendations ranging over the map, NASA onceagain had no clear way to proceed. Six months earlier, a similarconfusion over choice of boosters had worked to NASA's advantage, byopening the door to new possibilities that included the winged S-IC.The situation now was different; the agency wanted to narrow itsalternatives, not expand them. Yet within the contractors' reports,data on costs gave an overriding basis for a decision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Between January and March, while thedevelopment cost of a pressure-fed booster stayed virtually constant,the SSME escalated sharply and the orbiter went higher still. Aninternal OMB memo, from the economist Sullivan to Rice, summarizedNASA's own estimate of the changes, in millions of dollars:</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">1/3/72 Estimate         (Pressure-fed)</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pressure-fed</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Current Estimates         Pump-fed</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Solids</FONT></CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=5 WIDTH=530>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Orbiter</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">3,058</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">3,660</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">3,660</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">3,750</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Main Engine</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">450</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">580</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">580</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">580</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Booster</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">1,390</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">1,400</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">1,080</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">350</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Program Support</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">602</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">570</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">560</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">470</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=5 WIDTH=530>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Total</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5,500</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">6,210</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5,880</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5,150</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=131>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Cost/flight</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=121>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">7.7</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=94>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">9.3</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=117>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">8.6</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=67>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">10.4</FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The situation was not completely bleak; theincreased cost of the orbiter, as much as $700 million, included $260million for specialized solid rockets[<A NAME="421"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">421</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] that might be useful in abort. Sullivan noted thatthe justification for this abort system "seems weak," and it soon wasdropped from the design. As a result, these estimates could bereduced.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When, however, NASA officials confirmed theseestimates, they threw in the towel. Both Weinberger and Shultz hadinsisted that NASA stay within a $5.5 billion development cost, andit would be most unseemly if the program were to start with aprojected cost overrun that would violate this limit. This wouldhappen quite severely with the pressure-fed option; it would alsohappen with the less costly pump-fed booster, even with the abortsystem deleted. Moreover, while the projected costs for the solidsdrew on Air Force experience and were both low and firm, estimatesfor either of the liquid-fueled options were dodgy and likely toincrease by the next design review.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The strong case of a solid motor also gave astrong case for choosing the solid motor. No one had previously triedto recover and reuse a solid booster; those of the Titan III hadsimply plopped into the deep, to provide homes for fishes. Early inJanuary, a NASA official had said, "It is not contemplated at thistime that a solid-rocket booster would be recoverable." Yet themodest staging velocity of the solids, as low as 4000 ft/sec, meantthat their heavy casings could easily serve as a heat sink. They alsocould withstand the stress of dropping by parachute into the ocean.NASA-Marshall and its contractors found that reusability of thesesolids would cut the cost per flight to around $10 million, allowingthe Shuttle to maintain its advantage and to capture its traffic fromexpendables. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA also had to consider the danger of thesea, for inevitably, some boosters would be lost. The high cost of aliquid booster meant that losing even one of them would be quiteexpensive. Moreover, although the pump-fed booster would save ondevelopment costs through its use of the existing F-1 engine, itsthin-walled structure would easily sustain damage while afloat. Thecasing of a solid booster would cost much less. It would berelatively impervious to damage, and the occasional loss of such acasing would not compromise the program's overall economics.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Low write that at the end of February, "DaleMyers presented the OMSF and OMSF/Center recommendation, which was togo with...solid [<A NAME="422"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">422</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] rocket motorboosters." Fletcher took the news to a meeting with David, Anders,Flanigan, and Rose. In Fletcher's words, "There was uniform agreementin the group that we had made the right choice." He also met withWeinberger, who "seemed quite receptive" to NASA's decision.Weinberger also agreed that there was no need to make a new decisionon the size of the orbiter; that choice had already been made inearly January. Low met with Rice and wrote that "he appeared toaccept our conclusions, almost as though he had invented themhimself." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The director of NASA-Marshall, Eberhard Rees,had expressed hope that the shuttle would use a liquid booster,because that would provide more work for his center. Although he hadbeen deeply involved with liquid rockets since the wartime V-2effort, he now would have to change with the times. The Shuttle woulduse two 156-inch boosters,</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> which were aslarge as could travel on American railroads. Only nine such solidshad been test fired-five by Thiokol, four by Lockheed-and Marshallwould have plenty to do in bringing them to a level of reliabilitythat would allow them to carry astronauts. Marshall also would managethe development and production of the SSME and the external tank.This center thus would not wither on the vine.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Budget officer William Lilly went over theestimates and came up with a development cost of $5.15 billion, wellbelow the target of $5.5 billion. Myers objected, insisting that hecould accept no lower figure than $5.34 billion, but Low sided withLilly and persuaded Myers to accept his number. Naturally, this wasthe one that went to the OMB. It did, however, include the $260million for the abort system that later was discarded, and thuscarried a margin for further reduction. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">25</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With this, the Shuttle took form in the shapethat NASA would build and that flies to this day. Ironically, thoughit was a NASA project from the start, its main design featuresreflected pressures from outside that agency. The Air Force hadpushed for the large payload capacity and the high crossrange thatcalled for a delta wing; while NASA later accepted these features andmade [<A NAME="423"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">423</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] them its own, theinitial impetus had come from the Pentagon. Similarly, the solidboosters came from the OMB. Left to its own devices, NASA surelywould have picked a liquid booster such as the fully-reusable wingedheat-sink type that flourished during the second half of 1971. Inthis fashion, the Air Force and OMB crafted a design that NASA wouldconstruct and operate.</FONT></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Loose Ends II: NERVA and CapeCanaveral</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA now was not only ready to proceed withthe orbiter it wanted; it also could look ahead to having most of theprincipal elements of George Mueller's integrated space program of1969, which he had planned to culminate in piloted missions to Mars.That program envisioned a Space Shuttle, approval for which was inhand. It called for a space tug, which was on the agenda as part ofthe development of the operational Shuttle. Mueller had looked aheadto astronaut-tended spacecraft, including a Large Space Telescopethat would take shape as today's orbiting Hubble instrument. These,too, were in prospect in 1972. Space station modules, launched by theSaturn V, were key elements in his scenario, with variants of thesemodules evolving into portions of Mueller's eventual Mars ship.Though the Saturn V would fly no more, Fletcher had pushedsuccessfully for a shuttle that could serve to build a future spacestation. This effort would come to the forefront during the1980s.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA needed one more element to make thisframework complete. It needed the NERVA nuclear rocket, which wouldpower the Mars mission. Work in Nevada with experimental nuclearengines had brought this technology to an advanced level that wasready for mainstream development, and NERVA held influential supportin Congress. If this program could go forward, NASA might yet be ableto set sail for the Red Planet.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During FY 1970, NERVA moved into a phase ofdetailed design and hardware fabrication. The goal now was notfurther research, but rather the development of a flight-qualifiedengine with 75,000 pounds of thrust, at a cost of $860 million over aperiod of eight to nine years. The program received $88 million in FY1970 and $85 million in FY 1971, with the funds coming jointly fromNASA and the Atomic Energy Commission.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On Capitol Hill, its political support wasunassailable. The program had a research center at Los Alamos, NewMexico. The</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> NationalJournal</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> described[<A NAME="424"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">424</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] that state's Senator Clinton Anderson as "NERVA'smost zealous and watchful guardian over the years." Anderson was oneof the most senior Democrats in the Senate, and chaired its spacecommittee. The test area was in Nevada; hence the program also heldstrong support from that state's Senator Howard Cannon, anotherinfluential Democrat who was also a member of the space committee.Indeed, support for NERVA was bipartisan. Westinghouse was buildingits reactors in Pennsylvania, home to another key supporter: theleader of the Senate's Republicans, Hugh Scott. In the House, thePennsylvania congressman James Fulton was the most senior Republicanwithin that chamber's space committee. He took a strong stand forNERVA as well.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, NERVA faced opposition withinthe OMB. As one of its officials said, "Here we had a high technologyprogram that was expensive as hell, averaging $100 million a year. Ithad a long-term potential, but NASA didn't know for a long time whatthey were going to do with it. It was a logical place in the budgetto raise questions."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Late in 1970, amid preparation of the FY 1972budget, NASA and the AEC requested a total of $88 million. By then,however, NASA was abandoning Mueller's bold Mars plan. There was noneed for rapid development of NERVA, which was likely to be readylong before any mission could use it. NASA decided to slow it down bylowering its priority. The OMB responded by treating it as a splendidopportunity to save money by canceling it outright. When the smokecleared, the budget request for NERVA was down by four-fifths, toonly $17.4 million.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Late in January 1971, at a NASA budgetbriefing, George Low went out of his way to deny that his agencystill was looking ahead to a piloted mission to Mars, saying, "Wehave in our program today no plans for a manned Mars landing." Heactually had plans aplenty, but he was telling the truth; they werenot in the program. NERVA stood at their core, and NERVA by then wasdying.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Congress, exercising its power of the purse,appropriated $69 million for the program. Nixon, however, held theright to impound funds and refuse to spend them. A few years later,that power would be curtailed by the Impoundment Control Act, but inthis fashion he released only $29 million for FY 1972, withholdingthe rest. That did it; when Fletcher sent his FY 1973 budget requestto Shultz, in September 1971, he abandoned hope of building anuclear-powered engine suitable for Mars.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This decision ended a longstanding NASA policyof developing advanced [<A NAME="425"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">425</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] engines well beforethere was need for them. The agency had contracted with Rocketdyne tobuild the F-1 as early as January 1959, over two years before Kennedycalled for Apollo. Development of the J-2 dated to September 1960.The demise of NERVA meant that nobody would be flying to Mars,perhaps not even within our lifetimes. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">26</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There also was a good deal of politics inanother issue: where to launch the Shuttle. Though NASA had anobvious interest in using the Apollo launch facilities at CapeCanaveral, the Shuttle was not the Saturn V and plenty of people inother areas of the country were ready to propose that they couldoffer sites having unique advantages. All these people demandedcareful attention, for they had congressmen and senators as well asaccess to local newspapers.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The merits of Cape Canaveral were undeniable.In addition to its Apollo facilities, it was on the IntracoastalWaterway; hence barges could bring oversize rocket stages from suchlocations as NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility, a government-ownedplant near New Orleans that had built the S-IC. The southerlylatitude of the Cape also meant that rockets launched from this sitewould benefit from the earth's rotation, which would impart avelocity of up to 914 mph while a vehicle sat on its pad.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Cape, however, had disadvantages as well.Though many military launches demanded a polar orbit, but Canaveralcould not accommodate rocket flights to due north or south; theymight drop spent stages on the Carolinas or Cuba. The Air Force hadbuilt its own separate facilities at California's Vandenberg AirForce Base to get around this. The Cape was subject to corrosion fromsalt air. It needed a 10,000-foot runway to land the Shuttle, andwhile this was feasible, the Cape often had cloudy or rainy weather.Lying at sea level, it required rockets to blast their way throughthe entire thickness of the atmosphere.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As early as April 1970, NASA's Tom Paine setup a 14-member Space Shuttle Facilities Group, which went on toevaluate both the Cape and the alternatives. NASA also contractedwith the Ralph M. Parsons Co., a major heavy-construction firm, toprovide independent outside advice. Some 20 states went on to proposeover a hundred possible locations, though many bidders had littleidea of what NASA needed. Mill Creek, Oklahoma invited[<A NAME="426"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">426</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] NASA to use its town airfield; Brownsville, Texas putin a word for the nearby Cameron County Airport. Another bid camefrom Michigan's upper peninsula. The source was an unemployed truckdriver who told the New York </FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">Times</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, "Some of myfriends and I were drinking it up a little at the town bar, and thisguy came in who had just read about the space basecompetition..."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, there was at least one seriousalternative: the Army's White Sands Missile Range with its adjacentHolloman Air Force Base. Holloman offered existing runways along witha 4000-foot elevation to complement its southerly latitude, thusgiving a double boost to a shuttle. Located amid high desert, itsweather was virtually cloudless and its flying conditions nearlyideal. An arid climate discouraged corrosion. The remoteness of WhiteSands also stimulated thoughts of all-azimuth launches, whereby thissingle facility would fire the Shuttle into both NASA and Air Forceorbits. A community of missile specialists had worked here sinceWorld War II. This location had another important resource: thepowerful Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, its home state, whowas ready to fight vigorously for its selection.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Anderson, however, was not the only Washingtonbaron with eyes on this prize. Another was Congressman Olin Teague,chairman of the Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight within the Housespace committee. A committee staffer noted that early in 1970,</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA and industry spokesmen suddenly   began pointing out that the shuttle potentially could be launched   from almost anywhere in the United States. At that juncture, a   number of congressmen discovered that they had phased-down or   abandoned facilities or Air Force bases in their districts. So   Teague and the subcommittee decided they had better make their   position-and that of the full committee-clear from the   outset.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In December, he came out strongly in favor ofCape Canaveral, reacting with vigor against the suggestion that theShuttle might go anywhere else. He warned, "Unless I am convincedthat NASA is making maximum use of existing facilities, I intend tooppose any money for the shuttle in every way, form or fashion." Helater added that NASA had better put the base at Canaveral, "or comeup with a goddamned good case for its removal."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA thus had to do a lot of stroking. InOctober 1970, George Low assured Senator Anderson that White Sandswould receive close scrutiny. The [<A NAME="427"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">427</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] following March,Dale Myers reaffirmed that the competition was far from over, anddescribed White Sands as the closest challenger to the Cape. When,however, NASA announced its decision, in April 1972, it statedclearly that it was not about to build a national Shuttle site in theNew Mexico desert. It awarded the palm to Cape Canaveral, withVandenberg AFB to serve for military launches.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In announcing the decision, George Low saidthat it would cost $150 million to modify the existing Apollofacilities, which included the Vehicle Assembly Building and Pads39-A and -B. Though Vandenberg had nothing resembling the VAB that itcould convert, it did have a big Titan III launch facility, SpaceLaunch Complex 6, known as Slick-Six. This site would require $500million, with the Air Force paying the bill. That service had nointention of sharing the cost of Shuttle development with NASA; NERVAmight have received its budget partly from NASA and partly from theAEC, but the Shuttle would be entirely a NASA project even though theAir Force was to receive many of its benefits. By promising to payfor its own launch facility at Vandenberg, this service showed thatit too would become actively involved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The rejection of both NERVA and White Sands,at nearly the same time, was a double defeat for Senator Anderson. Hewas, however, 76 years old and in poor health. In 1972, he announcedthat he would retire from the Senate and would not run forre-election. As chairman of that chamber's space committee, he haddone much for NASA. He would not be receiving any major base orprogram in New Mexico, to serve as his monument. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">27</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Awarding the Contracts</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The presidential campaign was in full swing inmid-1972, and on July 31 Jean Westwood, chairing the DemocraticNational Committee, issued a statement: </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">28</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Three days ago, the Nixon   Administration awarded the $2.6 billion space shuttle contract to   the North American Rockwell Corporation in California.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I regard this decision as the latest,   and perhaps most blatant, example of President Nixon's calculated   use of the American taxpayers' dollars for his</FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> [<A NAME="4273466"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">427</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">own re-election purposes....</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The award of this contract to North   American Rockwell also raises questions of ethics.

One wealthy man, Henry Mudd, had given all of $2000. Yet whilestating explicitly that Nixon could be bought and sold for the priceof a Volkswagen Beetle, she missed a potentially more significantstory: Dale Myers, who had spent his career at North American, hadput together the selection board that had picked this company as thewinner of the contract.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Myers was NASA's Associate Administrator forManned Space Flight. He was clearly aware of the potential forconflict of interest, for in Washington, it is well understood thatthe person who picks the membership of a review board can oftendetermine its decisions in advance. George Low also saw the potentialfor conflict, and discussed the matter with colleagues. He laterwrote that Myers "had fully divested himself of all his connectionswith North American and since this activity is so closely tied to allthat he is going to do over the next several years, it was necessarythat he should be involved."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Myers put together this board in January,while the choice of booster was still open. He picked its membersbased on their positions within NASA and their responsibilitieswithin the Shuttle program; the only non-NASA members were from theAir Force. A senior attorney provided legal counsel. Low wrote thathe "concurred fully and formally in the selection" of the members. Heand Myers also emphasized that the board "will conduct its businessin strict accordance with the provisions of the Source EvaluationBoard Manual."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Request for Proposals went out on March17, shortly after NASA had wrapped up the choice of the booster.Responses were due on May 12, and four companies replied: NorthAmerican Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, and Grumman.

These three men then made the final decision.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lockheed ranked fourth in the competition.Though its bid was only $40 million more than North American's, thisproposal looked like another attempt at buying in. Its shuttle washeavy, and Fletcher wrote that its design had "unnecessarycomplexity." Lockheed left a 65-second gap during ascent with noprovision for abort. It proposed an overly high landing speed, astructure that could accumulate moisture, and a program managementthat would rely on subcontractors to do much of the detailed design."We didn't see how they were going to drive all those horses and keepthe costs down," said McCurdy. "We ended up not believing theirproposal on costs."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lockheed also was the only bidder with noexperience in building piloted spacecraft. By contrast, McDonnellDouglas had been a mainstay in this area, for McDonnell Aircraft hadbuilt the Mercury and Gemini capsules[<A NAME="430"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">430</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] while Douglas Aircraft built the Skylab spacestation. This very breadth of experience, however, worked againstthis merged company, for the concepts within the proposal came partlyfrom Douglas in Huntington Beach, California and partly fromMcDonnell in St. Louis. "Their proposal was almost like two companyproposals," one source confided. "They gave the impression of neverhaving consummated their marriage, and we couldn't live withthat."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Moreover, the proposal projected a relativelyhigh cost, and showed technical weaknesses. It divided the flighttesting between Edwards Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral in a waythat required full data-handling capability at both sites. Itsdiscussion of ground operations did not reflect recent companyexperience in the Apollo program. In addition to this, althoughDouglas had designed its DC-10 airliner for easy maintenance, theprovisions in the proposal for maintainability of the Shuttle failedto adequately make use of this background.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The company might have strengthened its bidwith a good presentation to Fletcher, Low and McCurdy, but this didnot go well. Low wrote that this briefing </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">really did not answer any questions.   For example, we still don't know who the Chief Engineer on the   Shuttle will be. Answers in general were broad, generalized, and   weak. The attitude displayed was 'we are a great company and you   had better give us the job because we will do the best job for   you.'"</FONT></I>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">McDonnell Douglas came away ranked third in   the competition.</FONT></P></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That left Grumman and North American, whichtogether had built the piloted spacecraft of Apollo. "Theirs is themost recent, the most intense and the most demanding experience withmanned space flight," McCurdy said. "There's no question it helpedthem formulate their proposals."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Grumman actually gained the highest score inthe technical areas. Its configuration was not perfect, with Fletchernoting "complex designs" in guidance, control, navigation, and dataprocessing. He, however, wrote that "Grumman's design went to agreater depth of detail than those of the other companies. Itsdetailed weight estimates were substantiated by the design details."Its structural layouts showed "a thorough understanding of potentialproblems and positive solutions," and were simple andstraightforward. [<A NAME="431"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">431</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] "Grumman did a verygood job in proposing design features to enhance maintainability," headded. "The provisions it made for access throughout the vehicle wereoutstanding."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Grumman, however, was less outstanding in costand management. Its proposed cost was higher than NASA liked.Fletcher saw why: the firm planned "to build up its work forcerapidly to an early manpower peak. This poses the risk of prematurehardening of the specifications and premature commitment of resourcesduring the course of the program." Grumman came in a strong secondoverall; its excellent design did not outweigh its shortcomings inthese other areas.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American's concept showed weaknesses,such as a crew cabin that would be difficult to build. Ironically,its overall strength stemmed in part from a near-disaster: the flightof Apollo 13, which had an onboard explosion and barely survived.Fletcher wrote that this company's "good understanding of allelectric power subsystems reflected the very thorough studies thatNorth American made following the Apollo 13 accident, which had itsorigin in an electrical subsystem."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It "provided the lightest dry weight of any ofthe designs submitted." It "presented an excellent analysis ofmaintainability from the standpoint of design criteria and goals toachieve optimum turnaround conditions and timing between flights. Itdesigned its orbiter vehicle with very good overall accessibility formaintenance." For the critical functions of guidance, control, andnavigation, North American provided a "simple design with minimuminterfaces."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, the proposal wasparticularly strong in cost and management. Its projected cost wasthe lowest of the four, and Low noted "the universal opinion thatNorth American, indeed, will wind up with the lowest cost." Itachieved this in part by proposing a more measured approach tobuildup of employment. "We were impressed by the way North Americanhad thought through the personnel buildup," said McCurdy. "The othersattacked this problem a little more like a cavalry charge. NorthAmerican had the lowest number of man-years in its shuttle proposal.Man-years is where you save money, nowhere else."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This company also gained an edge through itsapproach to minority hiring. A confrontation with black employees in1969 had left North American determined to take the lead in promotingequal opportunity, and in 1972 this[<A NAME="432"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">432</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] firm had more blacks, Hispanics, and Asians than anyof the three competitors. NASA viewed this as advantageous, for asMcCurdy put it, "We're not crusaders for civil rights. But the factthat North American moved forward on this front tells us somethingabout how the company is thinking ahead."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher, Low, and McCurdy picked this winneron the afternoon of July 26. In Low's words, "we very quicklydetermined that all three of us wanted to select North AmericanRockwell on the basis of the highest score" and "the lowest cost."They then made phone calls to spread the news. When Fletcher phonedNorth American, just after lunchtime in California, he found thatthis company's executives already had gotten the word. Their localcongressman, Del Clawson, had received his own phone call from NASAearlier that afternoon, and beat Fletcher to the punch with a call ofhis own.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Had Nixon's hand steered the choice? "The lackof White House interest in this selection had been remarkable," Lowwrote. Prior to that week's round of meetings, he had asked Fletcher"whether he had any commitment to inform the White House what wasgoing on and whether they wanted to get into the act in any waywhatsoever. His answer was an emphatic no to both questions."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the company briefings, Low asked thebidders to comment on the fairness of the competition. In Low'swords, three of these firms "all indicated that this had been thebest and fairest competition they had ever participated in." SanfordMcDonnell, president of his firm, reserved the right to lodge aprotest, and Low noted that "in effect, Sandy McDonnell said that thecompetition was a fair one if we select McDonnell Douglas, and unfairif we select somebody else." However, he accepted the final decision.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">His conduct thus contrasted with that of Pratt&amp; Whitney, which had made just this type of formal protest a yearearlier, on losing the SSME competition to Rocketdyne. This complainthad the legal status of a lawsuit, directed not against Rocketdynebut rather against NASA, which allegedly had performed wrongful actsin selecting that contractor. With Pratt as the plaintiff and NASA asdefendant, Rocketdyne held the role of a highly interested witnesswhose testimony could help NASA in seeking to uphold this[<A NAME="433"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">433</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] award. The proceedings did not take place in federalcourt, but rather went forward under the Comptroller General, ElmerStaats. He issued his decision at the end of March 1972, whilepreparation of proposals for the complete Shuttle was underway.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pratt's attorneys, who were highly capable,argued that NASA had "failed to conduct meaningful negotiations."NASA's discussions with the bidders "did not include the pointing outof deficiencies or weaknesses and did not afford offerors anopportunity to improve their proposals." Staats would have none ofthis: </FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is also unfair, we think, to help   one proposer through successive rounds of discussions to bring his   original inadequate proposal up to the level of other adequate   proposals by pointing out those weaknesses which were the result   of his own lack of diligence, competence, or   inventiveness.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Had NASA "erroneously and illegally accepted anonresponsive proposal?" Though this introduced engineering issues,Staats found "no basis to object to the technical judgment reached."Was it true that "NASA's determination of Pratt &amp; Whitney'sdeficiencies was arbitrary and capricious?" Pratt charged that NASAhad failed to respond to requests for information, had unfairlypenalized certain technical deficiencies in its proposal while givingRocketdyne something of a free ride, and had failed "to read andfully comprehend" this proposal. Staats wrote, "The administrativereport contains a detailed rebuttal of these contentions." NASA'sevaluations "provided a sound basis for selecting the mostadvantageous proposal."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pratt also complained that "selection ofRocketdyne wastes eleven years" of its experience. Though Prattindeed had devoted much effort to its XLR-129 rocket engine, Staatsconcluded that NASA had fairly weighed the merits of this engine andhad not overlooked its advantages in determining that "Rocketdyneoffered the superior technical approach." NASA had been obliged togive due weight to the experience of Pratt, and had done this.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Staats disagreed with another contention: thatRocketdyne's design invited a cost overrun. He concluded thatRocketdyne's cost estimates had been well substantiated. Similarly,he did not accept that Rocketdyne had "obtained an unfair competitiveadvantage by diversion of Saturn funds to the SSME[<A NAME="434"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">434</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] proposal effort." He cited an audit by which"Rocketdyne determined the amount involved to be $2,526, and that ithas made appropriate adjustments to the respective contracts."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He concluded, "We believe the procurement wasconducted in a manner which was consistent with applicable law andregulations and was fair to all proposers." The contract award toRocketdyne would stand; Pratt's attempt to overturn it had failed.Rocketdyne indeed would design and build the SSME. Because thisdivision was part of North American Rockwell, the subsequent award ofthe main Shuttle contract to this company's Space Division gave thisfirm responsibility for the entire Shuttle orbiter, including itsengine. This was more than North American had carried during Apollo,more than it had held since the days of Navaho some 20 yearsearlier.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now that Rocketdyne had the SSME, it intendedto keep it. On receiving the initial contract award the previousJuly, William Bergen, president of North American, had approachedPratt &amp; Whitney, inviting that company to share in the enginedevelopment. Pratt chose instead to pursue its appeal, and Low wrotein April 1972 that "there may be a lot of bad blood between the 2companies. Certainly it is not our intent to force a marriage at thistime between Pratt and Whitney and Rocketdyne."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In building the orbiter, however, the SpaceDivision would generously share the work by awarding importantsubcontracts to its rivals. In March 1973, North American-now knownas Rockwell International-gave Grumman responsibility for theorbiter's delta wing, and granted McDonnell Douglas the right tobuild the small onboard rocket system that would be used for on-orbitmaneuvers. NASA conducted additional contract competitions during1973, choosing Martin Marietta to build the external tank andselecting Thiokol for the solid rocket boosters. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The events of 1972 brought an end to NASA'ssearch for a post-Apollo future. The search had begun in 1965, whenGeorge Mueller had set up his Apollo Applications program office.This effort led to Skylab, but that offered no more than one moreyear of piloted missions. Characteristically, Mueller responded byseeking a larger space station that could fly atop a Saturn V. TheShuttle then grew out of this new pursuit, initially as a logisticsvehicle [<A NAME="435"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">435</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] but growing to takeon a life of its own.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Why, finally, did Nixon decide to build theShuttle? One must not underestimate the tendency of the federalgovernment to look after its own; few major Washington programs reachan end, to vanish into the night. Nixon had no wish to shut downpiloted space flight; he wanted to keep it alive. He also wasconcerned over aerospace employment. Yet he could have addressed suchissues with nothing more than Big Gemini riding atop a Titan III-M,to fly occasionally and show the flag.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The key to the Shuttle was its well-foundedprospect of low cost and routine operation. This promise did not reston the cost-benefit studies of Mathematica, which the Flax Committeelargely refuted and the OMB rejected out of hand. Rather, it restedon technical developments: automated onboard checkout, reusablethermal protection, rocket engines with long life. No OMB internalmemo or White House report ever denied this promise; only experiencewould do that, years later. The Shuttle thus could find its way toapproval, within a nation and government that remained willing toembrace the new.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During 1972, the Shuttle entered a new phase,as a mainstream aerospace program. The debates and arguments werefinished. NASA now held its future in its own hands, withresponsibility for executing what it had planned and delivering whatit had promised.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Footnotes</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">.Manchester, Glory, pp. 1159-1160; John Logsdon interview, JohnEhrlichman, Santa Fe, May 6, 1983, pp. 21, 25-26; Eugene Emmeinterviews, Thomas Paine, Washington: August 3, 1970, pp. 27-28;September 3, 1970, pp. 13-14.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">.
