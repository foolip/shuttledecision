speak seriously of a space shuttle, there had to be a widespread
awareness that such a craft would be useful and perhaps even worth
building. A shuttle would necessarily find its role within an
ambitious space program; and while science-fiction writers had been
prophesying such wonders since the days of Jules Verne, it was
another matter to present such predictions in ways that smacked of
realism. After World War II, however, the time became ripe. Everyone
knew of the dramatic progress in aviation, which had advanced from
biplanes to jet planes in less than a quarter-century. Everyone also
recalled the sudden and stunning advent of the atomic bomb. Rocketry
had brought further surprises as the Germans bombarded London with
long-range V-2 missiles late in the war. Then, in 1952, a group of
specialists brought space flight clearly into public view.</FONT>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Collier's Series</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of these specialists, the German
expatriate Willy Ley, had worked with some of the builders of the V-2
personally and had described his experiences, and their hopes, in his
book </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rockets, Missiles, and Space
Travel </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">. The first version, titled Rockets, appeared in May
1944, just months before the first [<A NAME="2"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] firings of the V-2 as
a weapon. Hence, this book proved to be very timely. His publisher,
Viking Press, issued new printings repeatedly, while Ley revised it
every few years, expanding both the text and the title to keep up
with fast-breaking developments. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One day in the spring of 1951, Ley had lunch
with Robert Coles, chairman of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan.
He remarked that interest in astronautics was burgeoning in Europe.
An international conference, held in Paris the previous October, had
attracted over a thousand people. That none had come from the U.S.,
however, suggested to Ley that Americans should organize a similar
congress. Coles replied, "Go ahead, the planetarium is yours."</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ley proceeded to set up a symposium that took
place on Columbus Day. Admission was by invitation only. Some
invitations, however, went to members of the press. Among the
attendees were a few staffers from </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, a magazine
with a readership of ten million. Two weeks later, the managing
editor, Gordon Manning, read a brief news item about an upcoming Air
Force conference, in San Antonio, on medical aspects of space flight.
He sent an associate editor, Cornelius Ryan, to cover this meeting
and to see if it could turn into a story. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While no space enthusiast, Ryan was a
meticulous reporter, as he would show in such books as
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Longest Day</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> and </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">A Bridge Too
Far</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. At the meeting, he fell in with
Wernher von Braun, who had been technical director of the V-2
project. Von Braun, a consummate salesman, had swayed even
Hitler.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Over cocktails, dinner, and still more cocktails, Von
Braun proceeded to deliver his pitch. It focused on a space station
with an onboard crew, living and working in space. Von Braun declared
that it could be up and operating in orbit by 1967. It would have the
shape of a ring, two hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and would
rotate to provide centrifugal force that could substitute for gravity
in weightless space. The onboard staff of 80 people would include
astronomers operating a major telescope. Meteorologists, looking
earthward, would study cloud patterns and predict the weather.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To serve the needs of the Cold War, Von Braun
emphasized the use of a space station could have for military
reconnaissance. He also declared that it
[<A NAME="3"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] could operate as a high-flying bomber, dropping
nuclear weapons with great accuracy. To build it, he called for a
fleet of immense piloted cargo rockets (space shuttles, though the
term had not yet entered use) each weighing seven thousand tons, five
hundred times the weight of the V-2. Yet the whole program - rockets,
station and all - would cost only $4 billion, twice the budget of the
wartime Manhattan Project that had built the atomic
bomb.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva"> 6</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With its completion, the space station could
serve as an assembly point for a far-reaching program of exploration.
An initial mission would send a crew on a looping flight around the
moon, to photograph its unseen far side. Later, perhaps by 1977, a
fleet of three rockets would carry as many as 50 people to the moon's
Bay of Dew for a six-week period of wide ranging exploration using
mobile vehicles.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Eventually,
perhaps a century in the future, an even bolder expedition would
carry astronauts to Mars. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By the end of that evening, Von Braun had
converted Ryan, who now believed that piloted space flight was not
only possible but imminent. Returning to New York, Ryan persuaded
Manning that this topic merited an extensive series of articles that
eventually would span eight issues of the
magazine.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Manning then invited Von Braun, together with several
other specialists, to Manhattan for a series of interviews and
discussions. These specialists included Willy Ley; the astronomer
Fred Whipple of Harvard, a moon and Mars specialist; and Heinz Haber,
an Air Force expert in the nascent field of space medicine.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In preparing the articles, </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> placed heavy
emphasis on getting the best possible color illustrations. Artists
included Chesley Bonestell, who had founded the genre of space art by
presenting imagined views of planets such as Saturn, as seen closeup
from such nearby satellites as its large moon Titan. Von Braun's
engineering drawings and sketches of his rockets and spaceships which
were used by Bonestell and the other artists to create working
drawings for Von Braun's review. They would execute the finished
paintings only after receiving Von Braun's corrections and
comments.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

from his office in Burbank, California. He was building Disneyland,
his theme park in nearby Anaheim, and expected to advertise it by
showing a weekly TV program of that name over the ABC television

hour-long feature, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Man in

subsequent reruns, and emphasized the piloted lunar mission.

referred to Von Braun's cargo rockets as "shuttles" and "shuttle
rockets," and described the reusable third stage as "a winged vehicle
rather like an airplane." His payload weight of 72,000 pounds proved
to be very close to the planned capacity of 65,000 pounds for NASA's
space shuttle. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> He expected to
fuel his rockets with the propellants nitric acid and hydrazine,
which have less energy than the liquid hydrogen in use during the
1960s. Hence, his rockets would have to be very large. While his
loaded weight of 7,000 tons would compare with the 2,900 tons of
America's biggest rocket, the Saturn V,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Still, the influence of the </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> series echoed
powerfully throughout subsequent decades. It was this eight-part
series that would define nothing less than NASA's eventual agenda for
piloted space flight. Cargo rockets such as the Saturn V and the
space shuttle, astronaut moon landings, a space station, the eventual
flight of people to Mars - all these concepts would dominate NASA's
projects and plans. It was with good reason that, in the original
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> series, the space station and cargo rocket stood at
the forefront. By 1952, the concept of a space station had been in
the literature for nearly 30 years, while large winged rockets were
being developped as well.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Background to the Space
Station</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The concept of a space station took root
during the 1920s, in an earlier era of technical change that focused
on engines. As recently as 1885, the only important prime mover had
been the reciprocating steam engine. The advent of the steam turbine
yielded dramatic increases in the speed and power of both warships
and ocean liners. Internal-combustion engines, powered by gasoline,
led to automobiles, trucks, airships, and airplanes. Submarines
powered by diesel engines showed their effectiveness during World War
I. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After that war, two original thinkers
envisioned that another new engine, the liquid-fuel rocket, would
permit aviation to advance beyond the Earth's atmosphere and allow
the exploration and use of outerspace. These inventors were Robert
Goddard, a physicist at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts,
and Hermann Oberth, a teacher of mathematics in a </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">gymnasium</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
[<A NAME="7"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] in a German-speaking community in
Romania.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Goddard experimented much, wrote little, and was known
primarily for his substantial number of patents. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Oberth
contented himself with mathematical studies and writings. His 1923
book, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Die Rakete zu den
Planetenraumen</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> (The Rocket into
Interplanetary Space), laid much of the foundation for the field of
astronautics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Both Goddard and Oberth were well aware of the
ordinary fireworks rocket (a pasteboard tube filled with blackpowder
propellant). They realized that modern technology could improve on
this centuries-old design in two critical waysrespects. First, a
steel combustion chamber and nozzle in a rocket engine wcould perform
much better than pasteboard. Second, the use of propellants such as
gasoline and liquid oxygen (or hydrogen, perhaps) would produce far
more energy than blackpowder. Oberth produced two conceptual designs:
the Model B, an instrument-carrying rocket for upper-atmosphere
research, and the Model E, a spaceship. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Having demonstrated to his satisfaction that
space flight indeed was achievable, Oberth then considered its useful
purposes. While he was not imaginative enough to foresee the advent
of automated spacecraft (still well in the future), the recent war
had shown that, using life support systems, submarines could support
sizable crews underwater for hours at a time. Accordingly, he
envisioned that similar crews, with oxygen provided through similar
means, would live and carry out a variety of tasks in a space station
as it orbited the earth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Without describing the station in any detail,
he wrote that it could develop out of a plans for a large orbiting
rocket with a mass of "at least 400,000 kg":</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">But if we should let a rocket of this
   size travel around the earth, it would constitute a sort of
   miniature moon. It would then no longer need to be designed or
   equipped for descent and landing. Traffic between this satellite
   and earth could be carried out with smaller vehicles and these
   large rockets (let us call them observation stations) could be
   built to further dimensions for their particular purpose. If ill
   effects result from experiencing weightlessness over long periods
   of time (which I doubt), two such rockets could be connected with
   a cable and caused to rotate about each other.</FONT></I>

serve as an astronomical observatory:</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In space, telescopes of any size could
   be used, for the stars would not flicker...... Sufficient for an
   objective glass would be a large, lightly shaded, concave mirror
   made of sheet metal. If this were mounted by means of three metal
   rods at a distance of several kilometers from the rocket, we would
   have a telescope which, for most purposes, would be one hundred
   times superior to the best instruments on earth.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The station could also carry out earth
observations, while serving as a communications relay:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">With their sharp instruments they could
   recognize every detail on the earth and could give light signals
   to earth through the use of appropriate mirrors. They would enable
   telegraphic connections with places to which neither cables nor
   electrical waves can reach...... Their value to military
   operations would be obvious, be it that they are controlled by one
   of the belligerents or be it that high fees could be charged for
   the reports they could render. The station could observe every
   iceberg and could warn shipping, either directly or indirectly.
   The disaster of the Titanic of 1912, for example, could have been
   prevented in this way.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Oberth also considered the building of immense
orbiting mirrors, with diameters as large as one a 1,000
kilometers:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">For example, routes to Spitzbergen or
   to the northern Siberian ports could be kept free of ice. If the
   mirror had a diameter of only 100 km, it could make broad areas in
   the northern regions of the earth inhabitable through diffused
   light, and in our latitude it could prevent the fearful spring
   freezes and protect fruit crops from damage by night frosts in
   both spring and winter.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He recommended sodium as a lightweight
construction material. While it reacts strongly with oxygen, sodium
would remain inert in airless space. He also described how the
observation station also could serve as a fuel station: </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. . . if the hydrogen and oxygen are
   shielded from the sun's rays, they could be stored here for as
   long as desired in a solid state. A rocket which is filled here
   and launched from the observation station has no air resistance to
   overcome...... If we couple a large sphere of sodium sheet which
   is produced and</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
   [<A NAME="9"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">filled with fuel on
   location with a small, stoutly built rocket which pushes its fuel
   supply ahead of it and is continually supplied by it, then we have
   a very powerful and long-range vehicle which is easily capable of
   making the trip to other bodies of the universe.</FONT></I><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although Oberth was shy and retiring by
nature, the impact of his ideas, during subsequent decades, would
rival that of Von Braun's a generation later. Die Rakete spurred the
founding of rocket-research groups in Germany, the U.S., and the
Soviet Union. As early as 1898, Russia's Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a
provincial math teacher like Oberth, had developed ideas now similar
to those of Oberth's. Officials of the new Bolshevik government then
dusted off Tsiolkovsky papers, showing that he had been ahead of the
Germans. As his writings won new attention, the Soviet Union emerged
as another center of interest in rocketry. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fritz Lang, a leading German film producer,
then became interested. M ore than a filmmaker, Lang was a leader in
his country's art and culture. Later, Willy Ley notes that at one of
his premieres, "The audience comprised literally everyone of
importance in the realm of arts and letters, with a heavy sprinkling
of high government officials." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">25</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> In 1926, Lang
released the classic film </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Metropolis</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, with a robot
in the leading role. Two years later, he set out to do the same for
space flight with </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Frau im
Mond</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> (The Girl in the Moon).</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Drawing heavily on Oberth's writings, Lang's
wife, actress Thea von Harbou, wrote the script for </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Frau im Mond</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. Fritz Lang
hired Oberth as a technical consultant. Oberth then convinced Lang to
underwrite the building of a real rocket. After all, it would be
great publicity for the movie were such a rocket to fly on the day of
the premiere. The project attracted a number of skilled workers who
went on to build Germany's first liquid-fuel rockets. Among them, a
youthful Wernher von Braun went on to develop the V-2 with support
from the German army. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">26</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even during the 1920s, Oberth's ideas drew
enough attention to encourage other theorists and designers to pursue
similar thoughts and to write their own books. Herman Potocnik, an

the imagination of that generation. Instead, a large parabolic mirror
would focus sunlight onto boiler pipes in a type of steam engine. For
more power, a trough of mirrors would run around the station's
periphery concentrating solar energy on another system of pipes. Like
a flower, the station would face the sun. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

appeared quickly in German translation).</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

Braun's concept included a circumferential trough of solar mirrors
for power. This, however, came not from Potocnik but rather from a
suggestion of Fred Whipple (who had not read Potocnik's book), and,
thus, represented an independent invention.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

of Potocnik on Von Braun may have been only indirect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian John Hunley, who has prepared an
English translation of Potocnik's book, describes its influence on
Von Braun as "probable but speculative." Nevertheless, he states
unequivocally that "Potocnik's book was widely known even to people
who may have seen only photographs of sections from the book in
translation." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> His concept of
a large rotating wheel was sufficiently simple to permit Von Braun

</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While space stations came quickly to the
forefront in public attention, it was another matter to build them,
even in versions much smaller than Von Braun's 250-foot wheel.
Between 1960 and 1980 the concept flourished only briefly, in the
short-lived Skylab program. The second major element of the
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> scenario, the winged rocket, enjoyed considerably
better prospects. At first merely topics for calculation and
speculation, the development of long-range winged rockets during
World War II was the departure point for a number of serious postwar
projects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the 1930s, work on winged rockets led to
the development of a high-speed airplane able to land on a runway for
repeated flights. The first important treatment came from Eugen
Sanger, a specialist in aeronautics and propulsion who received a
doctorate at the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Technische
Hochschule</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">33</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> in Vienna and
stayed on to pursue research on rocket engines. In 1933, he published
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Raketenflugtechnik</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> (Rocket Flight Engineering). The first text in this
field, it included a discussion of rocket-powered aircraft
performance a set of drawings. Sanger proposed achieving velocities
as high as Mach 10, along with altitudes of up to 70 kilometers.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While the turbojet engine was unknown at that
time, it was this engine, rather than the rocket, that would offer
the true path to routine high performance. Given that a turbojet uses
air from the atmosphere, its aircraft need carry fuel only and is,
therefore, able to carry more fuel and, thus, maintain longer flight
times. By contrast, a rocket must carry oxygen as well as fuel, and
thus, while capable of high speeds, lacks endurance. After World War
II, rocket airplanes as experimental aircraft went on to reach speeds
and altitudes far exceeding those of jets. Jet planes, however, took
over the military and, later, the commercial realms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During World War II, Sanger made a further
contribution, showing how the addition of wings could greatly extend
a rocket's range. Initially, a winged rocket would fly to modest
range, along an arcing trajectory like that of an artillery shell.
Upon reentering the atmosphere, however, the lift generated by....

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In haste and desperation, winged rockets
entered the realm of hardware late in the war, as an offshoot of the
V-2 program. The standard V-2 had a range of 270 kilometers.
Following the Normandy invasion in 1944, as the Allies surged into
France and the Nazi position collapsed, a group of rocket engineers
led by Ludwig Roth sought to stretch this range to 500 kilometer by
adding swept wings to allow the missile to execute a supersonic
glide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The venture was ill-starred from the outset.
When winds blew on the wings during liftoff, the marginal guidance
system could not prevent the vehicle from rolling and going out of
control. In this fashion, the first winged V-2 crashed within seconds
of its December 1944 launch. A month later, a second attempt was
launched successfully and had transitioned to gliding flight at Mach
4 when a wing broke off causing the missile to break up high in the
air. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">37</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, this abortive effort provided an
early point of departure for America's first serious long-range
missile effort. In the Army Air Forces (AAF), the Air Technical
Service Command (ATSC; renamed Air Materiel Command in March 1946)
began by defining four categories of missiles: air-to-air,
air-to-surface, surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface. The last of
these included the V-2 and its potential successors.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The program began with a set of military
characteristics, outlined in August 1945, that defined requirements
for missiles in these categories. AAF Headquarters published these
requirements as a classified document. In November 1946, ATSC invited
17 contractors, most of them aircraft manufacturers, to submit
proposals for design studies of specific weapons. One of these firms
was North American Aviation (NAA) in Los Angeles.

decided to bring in the best scientist he could find and have him
build a new research lab, staffed with experts in such fields as jet
propulsion, rockets, gyros, electronics, and automatic control. The

toward bringing in new business by extending the reach of the firm's
technical qualifications. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An executive recruiter, working in Washington,
D.C., recommended William Bollay to head this lab. Bollay, who held a
Ph.D. in aeronautical engineering from Caltech, had been a branch
chief in the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, with responsibility for
the development of turbojet engines. He came to NAA by November 1946,
in time to deal with the AAF request for proposals. Working with the
company's chief engineer, Raymond Rice, Bollay decided to pursue the
winged V-2, which the Germans had designated as the A-9. During World
War II, the Germans had regarded this missile as the next step beyond
the standard V-2, hoping that its wings would offer a simple way to
increase its range. The V-2's overriding priority had prevented
serious [<A NAME="16"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">16</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] work on its winged
version. Late in 1945, however, the NAA proposal offered to
"essentially add wings to the V-2 and design a missile fundamentally
the same as the A-9." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A letter contract, issued to the firm in April
1946, called for the study and design of a supersonic guided missile
designated MX-770, with a range of 175 to 500 miles.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Meanwhile, rocket research was under way in an NAA
company parking lot, with parked cars only a few yards away. A
boxlike steel frame held a rocket motor; a wooden shack housed
instruments. The steel blade of a bulldozer's scraper was used as a
shield to protect test engineers in the event of an explosion.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">44</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

with a 1,000 pounds of thrust, served as the first test motor. The

initially with 50 to 300 pounds of thrust. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bollay and his colleagues also launched an
extensive program of consultation with Wernher von Braun and his
wartime veterans. These included [<A NAME="17"></A></FONT><B><FONT

Huter, Rudi Beichel, and Konrad Dannenberg. In addition, Dieter
Huzel, a close associate of Von Braun, went on to join NAA as a
full-time employee.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">48</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bollay wanted to test-fire V-2 engines.
Because their thrust of 56,000 pounds was far too great for the
company's parking lot test center, Bollay needed a major set of test
facilities. Atwood was ready to help. "We scoured the country,"
Atwood recalls. "It wasn't so densely settled then - and we located
this land." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">49</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> It was in the
Santa Susana Mountains, at the western end of the San Fernando
Valley. The landscape-stark, sere, and full of rounded reddish
boulders-offered spectacular views. In March 1947, NAA leased the
land and built a rocket test center on it as part of a buildup of
facilities costing upwards of $1 million in company money and $1.5
million from the Air Force. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">50</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1946, two government-furnished V-2 engines
arrived at the site. Detailed designing of the Phase II engine began
in June 1947; the end of September brought the first release of
drawings and of the first fabricated parts. Early in 1949, the first
such engine was completed. Two others followed shortly thereafter.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Still very much a V-2 engine, it had plenty of
room for improvement. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Hall, who was funding
the work, declared that "it wasn't really a very good engine. It
didn't have a proper injector, and that wasn't all. When we took it
apart, we decided that was no way to go." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">52</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> By fixing the
deficiencies during Phase III, NAA expected to lay a solid foundation
for future rocket engine development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A particular point of contention involved this
engine's arrangements for injecting propellants into its combustion
chamber. Early in the German rocket program, Walter Riedel, Von
Braun's chief engine designer, had built a rocket motor with 3300
pounds of thrust with a cup-shaped injector at the top of the thrust
chamber. For the V-2, a new chief of engine design, Walter Thiel,
grouped 18 such cups to yield its 56,000 pounds. Unfortunately, this
arrangement did not lend itself to a simple design wherein a single
liquid-oxygen line [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] could be supplied to the cups. Instead, his "18-pot
engine" required a separate oxygen line for each individual
cup.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Thiel had pursued a simpler approach by
constructing an injector plate, resembling a showerhead, pierced with
numerous holes to permit the rapid inflow and mixing of the rocket
propellants. By the end of World War II, Thiel's associates had
succeedfully tested a version of the V-2 engine that incorporated
this feature though it never reached production. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">54</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Bollay's rocket
researchers, still working within the company parking lot, were
upping their engines' thrust to 3000 pounds, and were using them to
test various types of injector plates. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">55</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The best
injector designs would be incorporated into the Phase III engine,
bringing a welcome simplification and introducing an important
feature that could carry over to larger engines with greater thrust.
In September 1947, preliminary design of Phase III began, aiming at
the thrust of the V-2 engine but with a weight reduction of 15
percent. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">56</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bollay had initially expected to design the
500-mile missile as a V-2 with swept wings and large control surfaces
near the stern, closely resembling the A-9. Work in a supersonic wind
tunnel built by Bollay's staff showed that this design would
encounter severe stability problems at high speed. Thus, by early
1948, a new configuration emerged. With small forward-mounted wings
(known as canards) that could readily control such instability, the
new design moved the large wings well aft, replacing the V-2's
horizontal fins. In January 1948, four promising configurations were
tested in the Ordnance Aerophysics Laboratory wind tunnel in
Daingerfield, Texas. By March, a workable preliminary design of the
best one of these four configurations was largely in hand.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A Navy effort, Project Bumblebee, had been
under way in this area since World War II and NAA had done several
relevant aerodynamic studies. In addition, at Wright Field, the Power
Plant Laboratory included a Nonrotating Engine Branch that was
funding the development of ramjets as well as rocket motors. Its
director, Weldon Worth, dealt specifically with ramjets; Lieut. Col.
Hall, who dealt with rockets, served as his
deputy.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">60</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though designed for boost-glide flight, the
new missile configuration readily accommodated ramjets and their fuel
tanks for supersonic cruise. The original boost-glide missile thus
evolved into a cruise missile when a modification of the design added
two ramjet engines, mounting one at the tip of each of two vertical
fins. These engines and their fuel added weight, which necessitated
an increase in the planned thrust of the Phase III rocket motor.
Originally it had been planned to match the 56,000 pound thrust of
the V-2. In March 1948, however, the thrust of this design went up to
75,000 pounds. The missile was named the Navaho, reflecting a
penchant at NAA for names beginning with "NA." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="21"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] By late November of
1949, the first version of this engine was ready for testing at the
new Santa Susana facility. Because it lacked turbopumps, propellants
were pressure-fed from heavy-walled tanks. Thus, this version of the
engine was much simpler than its later operational type, which would
rely on turbopumps to force propellants into the engine. Proceeding
cautiously, the rocket crew began with an engine-start test at 10
percent of maximum propellant flow for 11 seconds. It was successful
and led to somewhat longer starting tests in December. Then, as the
engineers grew bolder, they hiked up the thrust. In March 1950, this
simplified engine first topped its rated level of 75,000 pounds - for
four and a half seconds. During May and June, full-thrust runs,
exceeding a minute in duration, went well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, a separate developmental effort was
building the turbopumps. Late in March 1950, the first complete
engine, turbopumps included, was assembled. In August, this engine
fired successfully for a full minute - at 12.3 percent of rated
thrust. Late in October, the first full-thrust firing reached 70,000
pounds - for less than five seconds. In seven subsequent tests during
1950, however, only one, in mid-November, topped its rated thrust
level. This was due to problems with rough combustion during the
build up to full thrust. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">62</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The pressure-fed tests exhibited surges in
combustion-chamber pressure (known as "hard starts") that were
powerful enough to blow up an engine. Walther Riedel, one of the
German veterans, played an important role in introducing design
modifications that brought this problem under control. The problem of
rough combustion was new, however, and went beyond the German
experience. It stemmed from combustion instability in the engine's
single large thrust chamber. Ironically, the V-2's 18-pot motor had
avoided this difficulty. Acting as preliminary burners, its numerous
injector cups were too small to permit such instabilities.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">63</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following the successful full-thrust test of
November 1950, it was not until March 1951 that problems of unstable
combustion came under control.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">64</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> However, this
marked another milestone. For the first time, the Americans had
encountered and solved an important problem that the Germans had not
experienced. While combustion instabilities would recur repeatedly
during [<A NAME="22"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] subsequent engine
programs, the work of 1950 and 1951 introduced NAA to several methods
for solving this problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then, the design and mission of the Navaho
had changed dramatically. The August 1949 detonation of a Soviet
atomic bomb, the fall of China to communism, and the outbreak of the
Korean War in mid-1950 combined to signal to the nation that the
rivalry with the Soviet Union was serious and that Soviet technical
capability was significant. The designers at North American, working
with their Air Force counterparts, accordingly sought to increase the
range of the Navaho, to as much as 5,500 nautical miles, and thereby
give it intercontinental capability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the Pentagon in August 1950, conferences
among Air Force officials brought a redefinition of the program that
set this intercontinental range of 5,500 miles as a long-term goal. A
letter from Major General Donald Putt, director of research and
development within the Air Materiel Command, became the directive
instructing NAA to pursue this objective. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">65</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> An interim
version, Navaho II, with range of 2,500 nautical miles, seemed
technically feasible. The full-range version, Navaho III, represented
a long-term project that would go forward as a parallel effort.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">66</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 1,000-mile Navaho of 1948, with its Phase
III engine, had amounted to a high-speed pilotless airplane fitted
with both rocket and ramjet propulsion. This design, however, had
taken approaches based on winged rockets to their limit. The new
Navaho designs separated the rocket engines from the ramjets,
assigned each to a separate vehicle, and turned Navaho into a
two-stage missile. The first stage or booster, powered by liquid-fuel
rockets, accelerated the missile to Mach 3 and 58,000 feet. The
ramjet-powered second stage rode this booster during initial
ascent-similar to the way in which the space shuttle rides its
external tank today-and then cruised to its target at Mach 2.75
(about 1,800 mph.). </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

installation, totaling 240,000 pounds, provided the initial boost.
For Navaho III, NAA upgraded the engine to 135,000 pounds of thrust
and designed a three-engine cluster for that missile's booster.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">69</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1954 and 1955, the Air Force and Army made
a major push into long-range missiles - but these were not Navahos.
Instead, they were the Air Force's Atlas, Titan, and Thor, along with
the Army's Jupiter. When these new programs needed engines, however,
it was again NAA that produced the rocket motors that would do the
job. The Navaho's 135,000 pounds of thrust was upgraded to 139,000
and then again to 150,000 pounds. In addition to this, a parallel
effort at Aerojet General developed very similar engines for the
Titan. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">70</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We often talked about this basic rocket as a
strong workhorse, a rugged engine," says Paul Castenholz, a test
engineer who worked at Santa Susana. "I think a lot of these programs
evolved because we had these engines. We anticipated how people would
use them; we weren't surprised when it happened. We'd hear a name
like Atlas with increasing frequency, but when it became real, the
main result was that we had to build more engines and test them more
stringently." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">71</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Navaho of 1948, designed as a winged
rocket with ramjets, stood two steps removed from the missiles that
later would go on to deployment and operational status. First, the
versions of 1950 and after were designed and built as high-speed
aircraft with a separate rocket booster. Those versions were replaced
by the Atlas and other missiles of that era.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even though the Air Force cancelled the Navaho
program in 1957, its legacy lived on. Bollay's research center,
called the Aerophysics Laboratory, became the nucleus that allowed
NAA to take the lead in piloted space flight. In 1955, this
laboratory split into four new corporate divisions: Rocketdyne,
Autonetics, the Missile Division, and Atomics International.
Rocketdyne [<A NAME="25"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">25</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] became the nation's
premier builder of rocket engines. Autonetics emerged as a major
center for guidance and control. The Missile Division, later renamed
Space and Information Systems, built the Apollo spacecraft as well as
the second stage of the Saturn V moon rocket. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">72</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Navaho also left a legacy in its people.
Sam Hoffman, who brought the 75,000-pound engine to success, presided
over Rocketdyne as it built the main engines for the Saturn V. Paul
Castenholz headed development of the J-2, the hydrogen-fueled engine
that powered Saturn V's upper stages. John R. Moore, an expert in
guidance, became president of Autonetics. Dale Myers, who served as
Navaho project manager, went to NASA as Associate Administrator for
Manned Space Flight. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">73</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Navaho's engines, including those built in the
parallel effort at Aerojet General, represented a third legacy. Using
such engines, Atlas, Thor, and Titan were all successful as launch
vehicles. Upper stages were added to Thor which evolved into the
widely-used Delta. Additional upgrades raised the thrust of its
engine to 205,000 pounds. A cluster of eight such engines, producing
up to 1.6 million pounds of thrust, powered the Saturn I and Saturn
I-B boosters, which flew repeatedly in both the Apollo and Skylab
programs. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">74</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

Navaho program played a pioneering role as experimental aircraft,
planting seeds that would flourish for decades in aerospace
technology.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15: An Airplane for Hypersonic
Research</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the 1940s and 50s, the nation's main
centers for aeronautical research operated within a small federal
agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA; it
became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, in
1958). After World War II, NACA and the Air Force became active
increasingly in supersonic flight. Rocket-powered aircraft such as
the Bell X-1 and the Douglas Skyrocket set the pace. The X-1 broke
the sound barrier in 1947; the Skyrocket approached Mach 2 only
[<A NAME="26"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">26</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] four years later. Also, between 1949 and 1951, NAA
designed a new fighter, the F-100, planning it to be the first jet
plane to go supersonic in level flight. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">75</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Supersonic aviation brought difficult problems
in aerodynamics, propulsion, aircraft design, and stability and
control in flight. At least for flight speeds of Mach 2 and somewhat
higher, it did not involve the important issue of aerodynamic
overheating. Though fitted with rocket engines, the cited aircraft
were built of aluminum, which cannot withstand high temperatures. At
increasingly severe high speeds beyond Mach 4 lay the realm of
hypersonic flight where problems of heating would dominate.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, by the early 1950s, interest in
such flight speeds was increasing. This was due in part to the
growing attention given to prospects for an intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM), a rocket able to carry a nuclear weapon to
Moscow. In December 1950, the Rand Corp., an influential Air Force
think tank, reported that such missiles now stood within reach of
technology. The Air Force responded by giving a study contract to the
firm of Convair in San Diego, where, a few years earlier, the
designer Karel Bossart had nurtured thoughts of such missiles.
Bossart's new design, developed during 1951, called for the use of
the Navaho's 120,000-pound-thrust rocket engine. The design was
thoroughly unwieldy; it would stand 160 feet tall and weigh 670,000
pounds. Nevertheless, it represented a milestone. For the first time,
the Air Force had an ICBM design concept that it could pursue using
rocket engines that were already being developped.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">76</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Among the extraordinarily difficult technical
issues faced by the ICBM, the problem of reentry was paramount.
Because an ICBM's warhead would reenter the atmosphere at Mach 20 or
more, there was excellent reason to believe that it would burn up
like a meteor. As early as 1951, however, the NACA aerodynamicist H.
Julian Allen offered a solution. Conventional thinking held that
hypersonic flight would require the ultimate in slender needle-nose
shapes. Allen broke with this approach, showing mathematically that
the best design would introduce a nose cone as blunt or flat-faced as
possible. Such a shape would set up patterns of airflow that would
carry most of the heat of reentry away from the nose cone, rather
than delivering this heat to its outer surface.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">77</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="27"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">27</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] There was further
interest in hypersonics at Bell Aircraft Corp. in Buffalo. Here
Walter Dornberger, who had directed Germany's wartime rocket
development, was proposing a concept similar to Eugen Sanger's
skip-gliding rocket plane. The design of the rocket (known as the
Bomi-Bomber Missile) required a two-stage vehicle with each stage
winged, piloted, and rocket-powered. Dornberger argued that Bomi
would have the advantage of being able to fly multiple missions like
any piloted aircraft, and it could be recalled once in flight. By
contrast, an ICBM could fly only once and would be committed
irrevocably to its mission once in flight. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">78</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bell Aircraft, very active in supersonic
flight research, had built the X-1, which was the first through the
sound barrier. Also, Bell Aircraft was building the X-1A that would
approach Mach 2.5 and the X-2 that would top Mach 3.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">79</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Robert Woods, co-founder of the company and a member
of NACA's influential Committee on Aerodynamics, had been a leader in
the design of these aircraft. He also took a strong interest in
Dornberger's ideas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In October 1951, at a meeting of the Committee
on Aerodynamics, Woods called for NACA to develop a new research
airplane resembling the V-2, to "obtain data at extreme altitudes and
speeds, and to explore the problems of reentry into the atmosphere."
In January 1952, Woods wrote a letter to the committee, urging NACA
to pursue a piloted research airplane capable of reaching beyond Mach
5. He accompanied this letter with Dornberger's description of Bomi.
That June, at Woods's urging, the committee passed a resolution
proposing that NACA increase its program in research aircraft to
examine "problems of unmanned and manned flight in the upper
stratosphere at altitudes between 12 and 50 miles."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">80</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NACA already had a few people who were active
in hypersonics, notably the experimentalists Alfred Eggers and John
Becker, who had already built hypersonic wind tunnels.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">81</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> At NACA's Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Floyd
Thompson, the lab's associate director, responded to the resolution
by setting up a three-man study group chaired by Clinton Brown, a
colleague of Becker. In Becker's words, "Very few others at Langley
in 1952 had any [<A NAME="28"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">28</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] knowledge of
hypersonics. Thus the Brown group filled an important educational
function badly needed at the time." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">82</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">According to Thompson, he was looking for
fresh unbiased ideas and the three study-group members had shown
originality in their work. Their report, in June 1953, went so far as
to propose </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">commercial</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> hypersonic flight, suggesting that airliners of the
future might evolve from boost-glide concepts such as those of
Dornberger. At the more practical level, however, the group warmly
endorsed building a hypersonic research aircraft. NACA-Langley
already had a Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD), which was
using small solid-fuel rockets to conduct supersonic experiments.
Brown's group now recommended that PARD reach for higher speeds,
perhaps by launching rockets that could cross the Atlantic and be
recovered in the Sahara Desert. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">83</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">PARD, a NACA in-house effort, went forward
rapidly. In November 1953, it launched a research rocket that carried
a test nose cone to Mach 5.0. The following October, a four-stage
rocket reached Mach 10.4. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">84</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> To proceed with
a piloted research airplane, NACA's limited budget needed support
from the Air Force. Here too there was cross-fertilization. Robert
Gilruth, head of PARD and an assistant director of NACA-Langley, was
also a member of the Aircraft Panel of the Air Force's Scientific
Advisory Board. At a meeting in October 1953, this panel stated that
"the time was ripe" for such a research airplane, and recommended
that its feasibility "should be looked into." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">85</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next step came at a two-day meeting in
Washington of NACA's Research Airplane Projects Panel. Its chairman,
Hartley Soul&eacute;, had directed NACA's participation in research
aircraft programs since the earliest days of the X-1 project in 1946.
The panel considered specifically a proposal from Langley, endorsed
by Brown's group, to modify the X-2 for flight to Mach 4.5. They
rejected this concept, asserting that the X-2 was too small for
hypersonic work. The panel members concluded instead that "provision
of an entirely new research airplane is desirable."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">86</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NACA's studies of such an airplane would have
to start anew. In March 1954, John Becker set up a new group that
took on the task of defining a [<A NAME="29"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] design. Time was of
the essence; everyone was aware that the X-2 project, underway since
1945, had yet to make its first powered flight. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">87</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Becker
stipulated that "a period of only about three years be allowed for
design and construction." Hence NACA would move into the unknown
frontiers of hypersonics using technology that was already largely in
hand. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">88</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two technical problems stood out: overheating
and instability. Because the plane would fly in the atmosphere at
extreme speeds, it was essential that it be kept from tumbling out of
control. As on any other airplace, tail surfaces were to provide this
stability. Investigations had shown that these would have to be
excessively large. A Langley aerodynamicist, Charles McLellan, came
to the rescue. While conventional practice called for thin tail
surfaces that resembled miniature wings, McLellan now argued that
they should take the form of a wedge. His calculations showed that at
hypersonic speeds, wedge-shaped vertical fins and horizontal
stabilizers should be much more effective than conventional thin
shapes. Tests in Becker's hypersonic wind tunnel verified this
approach. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">89</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The problem of overheating was more difficult.
At the outset, Becker's designers considered that, during reentry,
the airplane should point its nose in the direction of flight. This
proved unacceptable because the plane's streamlined shape would cause
it to enter the dense lower atmosphere at excessive speed. This would
subject the aircraft to disastrous overheating and to aerodynamic
forces that would cause it to break up. These problems, however,
appeared far more manageable if the plane were to enter with its nose
high, presenting its flat undersurface to the air. It then would lose
speed in the upper atmosphere, easing both the overheating and the
aerodynamic loads. In Becker's words, "It became obvious to us that
what we were seeing here was a new manifestation of H. J. Allen's
'blunt body' principle. As we increased the angle of attack, our
configuration in effect became more 'blunt.'" </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">90</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> While Allen had
developed his principle for missile nose cones, it now proved equally
useful when applied to hypersonic airplanes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even so, the plane would encounter far more
heat and higher temperatures than any aircraft to date had received
in flight. New approaches in the [<A NAME="30"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] structural design of
these aircraft were imperative. Fortunately, Dornberger's group at
Bell Aircraft had already taken the lead in the study of "hot
structures." These used temperature-resistant materials such as
stainless steel. Wings might be covered with numerous small and very
hot metal panels resembling shingles that would radiate the heat away
from the aircraft. While overheating would be particularly severe
along the leading edges of the wings, these could be water-cooled.
Insulation could protect an internal structure that would stand up to
the stresses and forces of flight; active cooling could protect a
pilot's cockpit and instrument compartment. Becker described these
approaches as "the first hypersonic aircraft hot structures concepts
to be developed in realistic meaningful detail." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">91</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">His designers proceeded to study a hot
structure built of Inconel X, a chrome-nickel alloy from
International Nickel. This alloy had already demonstrated its
potential, when, during the previous November, it was used for the
nose cone in PARD's rocket flight to Mach 5. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">92</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The hot
structure would be of the "heat sink" type, relying on the high
thermal conductivity of this metal to absorb heat from the hottest
areas and spread it through much of the aircraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As an initial exercise, they considered a
basic design in which the Inconel X structure would have to withstand
only conventional aerodynamic forces and loads, neglecting any extra
requirements imposed by absorption of heat. A separate analysis then
considered the heat-sink requirements, with the understanding that
these might greatly increase the thickness and hence the weight of
major portions of the hot structure. When they carried out the
exercise, the designers received a welcome surprise. They discovered
that the weights and thicknesses of a heat-absorbing structure were
nearly the same as for a simple aerodynamic structure.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">93</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Hence a hypersonic research airplane, designed largely
from aerodynamic considerations, could provide heat-sink thermal
protection as a bonus. The conclusion was clear: piloted hypersonic
flight was achievable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The feasibility study of Becker's group was
intended to show that this airplane indeed could be built in the near
future. In July 1954, Becker presented the report at a meeting in
Washington of representatives from NACA, the Air Force's Scientific
Advisory Board, and the Navy. (The Navy, actively involved
[<A NAME="31"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></B><FONT

Skyrocket.) Participants at the meeting endorsed the idea of a joint
development program that would build and fly the new aircraft by
drawing on the powerful support of the Pentagon. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Important decisions came during October 1954,
as NACA and Air Force panels weighed in with their support. At the
request of General Nathan Twining, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the
Aircraft Panel of the Scientific Advisory Board presented its views
on the next 10 years of aviation. The panel's report paid close
attention to hypersonic flight:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, NACA's Committee on
Aerodynamics met in executive session to make a formal recommendation
concerning the new airplane. The committee included representatives
from the Air Force and Navy, from industry, and from universities.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">96</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> Its member from Lockheed, Clarence "Kelly" Johnson,
vigorously opposed building this plane, arguing that experience with
earlier experimental aircraft had been "generally unsatisfactory."
New fighter designs were advancing so rapidly as to actually outpace
the performance of research aircraft. To Johnson, their
high-performance flights had served mainly to prove the bravery of
the test pilots. While Johnson pressed his views strongly, he was in
a minority of one. The other committee members
[<A NAME="32"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></B><FONT

of a project to design and construct a research airplane capable of
achieving speeds of the order of Mach number 7 and altitudes of
several hundred thousand feet." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With this resolution, Hugh Dryden, the head of
NACA, could approach his Air Force and Navy counterparts to discuss
the initiation of procurement. Detailed technical specifications were
necessary and would come, by the end of 1954, from a new three-member
committee, with Hartley Soul&Egrave; as the NACA representative. The
three members used Becker's study as a guide in deriving the
specifications, which called for an aircraft capable of attaining
250,000 feet and a speed of 6600 feet per second while withstanding
re-entry temperatures of 1200 degrees Fahrenheit.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">98</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, as NACA and the military services
reached an agreement on procurement procedures, a formal Memorandum
of Understanding came from the office of Trevor Gardner, Special
Assistant for Research and Development to the Secretary of the Air
Force. This document stated that NACA would provide technical
direction, that the Air Force would administer design and
construction, and that the Air Force and Navy would provide the
funding. It concluded, "Accomplishment of this project is a matter of
national urgency." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now the project was ready to proceed. Under
standard Air Force practices, officials at Wright Field would seek
proposals from potential contractors. Early in 1955, the aircraft
also received a name: the X-15. Competition between proposals brought
the award of a contract for the airframe to NAA. The rocket engine
was contracted to Reaction Motors, Inc. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

went into such detail that it even specified the heat-resistant seals

Mach 6.72.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">102</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> In addition to
setting new records, the X-15 accomplished a host of other
achievements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A true instrument of hypersonic research, in
199 flights it spent nearly nine hours above Mach 3, nearly six hours
above Mach 4, and 82 minutes above Mach 5. Although the NACA and the
Air Force had hypersonic wind tunnels, the X-15 represented the first
application of aerodynamic theory and wind tunnel data to an actual
hypersonic aircraft. The X-15 thus enhanced the usefulness of these
wind tunnels, by providing a base of data with which to validate (and
in some instances to correct) their results. This made it possible to
rely more closely on results from those tunnels during subsequent
programs, including that of the space shuttle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 used movable control surfaces that
substituted for ailerons. It also introduced reaction controls: small
rocket thrusters, mounted to the [<A NAME="34"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] aircraft, that
controlled its attitude when beyond the atmosphere. As it flew to the
fringes of space and returned, the X-15 repeatedly transitioned from
aerodynamic controls to reaction controls and back again. Twenty
years later, the shuttle would do the same.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In another important prelude to the shuttle,
the X-15 repeatedly flew a trajectory that significantly resembled
flight to orbit and return. The X-15 ascended into space under rocket
power, flew in weightlessness, then re-entered the atmosphere at
hypersonic speeds. With its nose high to reduce overheating and
aerodynamic stress, the X-15 used thermal protection to guard the
craft against the heat of reentry. After reentry, the X-15 then
maintained a stable attitude throughout its deceleration,
transitioned to guiding flight, and landed at a preselected location.
The shuttle would do all these things, albeit at higher
speeds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 used a rocket engine of 57,000 pounds
of thrust that was throttleable, reusable, and "man-rated" - safe
enough for use in a piloted aircraft. The same description would
apply to the more powerful Space Shuttle Main Engine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The demands of the project pushed the
development of practical hypersonic technology in a number of areas.
Hot structures required industrial shops in which Inconel X could be
welded, machined, and heat-treated. The pilot required a pressure
suit for use in a vacuum. The X-15 required new instruments and data
systems including the "Q-ball," which determined the true direction
of airflow at the nose. Cooled by nitrogen, the "Q-ball" operated at
temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit and advised the pilot
of the angle of attack suitable for a safe reentry.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">103</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like the Navaho, the X-15 also spurred the
rise of people and institutions that were to make their mark in
subsequent years. At NACA-Langley, the X-15 combined with the rocket
flights of PARD to put an important focus on hypersonics and
hypervelocity flight. Leaders in this work included such veterans as
Robert Gilruth, Maxime Faget, and Charles Donlan.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">104</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> A few years later, these researchers parlayed their
expertise into leadership in the new field of piloted space missions.
In addition to this, part of NACA-Langley split off to establish the
new Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston as NASA's
[<A NAME="35"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">35</FONT></B><FONT

headed that center during the Apollo years, while Faget, who had
participated in Becker's 1954 X-15 feasibility study became a leading
designer of piloted spacecraft. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 program brought others to the
forefront as well. At NAA the vice president of the program, Harrison
"Stormy" Storms, became president of that company's Space Division in
1960. While Gilruth was running the Manned Spacecraft Center, Storms
had full responsibility for his division's elements of Apollo: the
piloted spacecraft and the second stage of the Saturn V moon
rocket.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">106</FONT></SUP></B><FONT

of this type could have many of the advantages of wings without
actually having any of these structures. Such craft would take shape
as "lifting bodies," wingless and bathtub-shapedcrafts that were able
to generate lift with their bodies. This would allow them to glide to
a landing. At the same time, such craft would dispense with the
weight of wings, and with their need for thermal protection.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">How can a bathtub generate lift, and fly? Lift
is pressure that is generated when the aerodynamic pressure is
greater below an aircraft than above it. Wings achieve this through
careful attention to their shape; a properly-shaped aircraft body can
do this as well. The difference is that wings produce little drag,
whereas lifting bodies produce a great deal of drag. Hence the
lifting-body approach is unsuitable for such uses as commercial
aviation, where designers of airliners seek the lowest possible drag.
Space flight, however, is another matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The lifting-body concept can be traced back to
the work of H. Julian Allen and Alfred Eggers, at NACA's Ames
Aeronautical Laboratory near San Francisco. Allen developed the
blunt-body concept for a missile's nose cone, developping it with
help from Eggers. They then considered that a re-entering body, while
remaining blunt to reduce the heat load, might have a shape that
[<A NAME="36"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">36</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] would give lift, thus allowing it to maneuver at
hypersonic speeds. The 1957 M-1 featured a blunt-nose cone with a
flattened top. While it had some capacity for hypersonic
maneuverability, it could not glide subsonically or land
horizontally. It was hoped that the new shape of the M-2 would do
these things as well. Fitted with two large vertical fins for
stability, it was a basic configuration suitable for further
research. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">108</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Beginning in 1959, a separate line of
development took shape within the Flight Dynamics Laboratory of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The program that developed sought to
advance beyond the X-15 by building small hypersonic gliders, which
would study the performance of advanced hot structures at speeds of
up to 13,000 miles per hour, three-fourths of orbital velocity. This
program was called ASSET-Aerothermodynamic/elastic Structural Systems
Environmental Tests. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">109</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The program went forward rapidly by remaining
small. The project's manager, Charles Cosenza, directed it with a
staff of four engineers plus a secretary, with 17 other engineers at
Wright-Patterson providing support.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">110</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> In April 1961,
the Air Force awarded a contract to McDonnell Aircraft Corp. for
development of the ASSET vehicle. McDonnell was already building the
small piloted capsules of Project Mercury; the ASSET vehicle was also
small, with a length of less than six feet. Not a true lifting body,
it sported two tiny and highly-swept delta wings. Its bottom, which
would receive the most heat, was a flat triangle. For thermal
protection, this triangle was covered with panels of columbium and
molybdenum. These would radiate away the heat, while withstanding
temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The nose was made of
zirconium oxide that would deal with temperatures of up to 4,000
degrees. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">111</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Beginning in September 1963 and continuing for
a year and a half, five of the six ASSET launches were successful.
They used Thor and Thor-Delta launch vehicles, the latter being a
two-stage rocket that could reach higher velocities. The boosters
lofted their ASSETs to altitudes of about 200,000 feet. The
spacecraft then would commence long hypersonic glides with ranges as
great as 2,300 nautical miles. Onboard instruments transmitted

did not attempt to produce data on overheating, for ASSET had covered
this point nicely, nor did it break new ground in its construction.
Slightly larger than ASSET, it used a conventional approach for
missile nose cones that featured an aluminum structure covered with a
thermally-protective "ablative" layer that would carry away heat by
vaporizing in a controlled fashion during reentry. The ablative
material also served as insulation to protect the underlying
aluminum.</FONT></P>

craft, however, used parachutes for final descent, making no attempt
to land like conventional aircraft. If lifting bodies were to truly
have merit, they would have to glide successfully not only at
hypersonic speeds but at the slow speed of an aircraft on a final
approach to a runway. Under the control of a pilot, lifting bodies
would have to maintain stable flight all the way to a horizontal
touchdown.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These requirements led to a second round of
lifting-body projects focusing on approach and landing. These
projects went forward on ASSET and PRIME at the same time. Robert
Reed, the initiator of this second round of projects, was a sailplane
enthusiast, a builder of radio-controlled model airplanes, and a NASA
engineer at Edwards Air Force Base. He had followed with interest the
work at NASA-Ames on the M-2 lifting-body shape, and he resolved to
build it as a piloted glider. He drew support from the local
community of aircraft homebuilders. Designated as the M2-F1, the
aircraft was built of plywood over a tubular steel frame. Completed
in early 1963, the aircraft was 20 feet long and 13 feet
across.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="40"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">40</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The M2-F1 needed a
vehicle that could tow it along the ground to help get it into the
air for initial tests. The M2-F1, however, produced a lot of drag and
needed a tow car with more power than NASA's usual vans and trucks.
Reed and his friends bought a stripped-down Pontiac with a big engine
and a four-barrel carb that could reach speeds of 110 mph. The car
was turned over to a funny car shop in Long Beach for modification.
Like any other flight-line vehicle it was sprayed yellow and
"NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION" was added on its
side. Initial piloted tow tests showed reasonable success, allowing
the project to use a C-47, called the Gooney Bird, for true aerial
tests. During these tests, the Gooney Bird towed the M2-F1 above
10,000 feet, then set it loose to glide to an Edwards AFB lake bed.
Beginning in August 1963, the test pilot Milt Thompson did this
repeatedly. Through these tests, Reed, working on a shoestring
budget, showed that the M-2 shape, optimized for hypersonic reentry,
could glide down to a safe landing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During much of this effort, Reed had support
from the NASA director at Edwards, Paul Bikle. As early as April
1963, he alerted NASA Headquarters that "the lifting-body concept
looks even better to us as we get more into it." The success of the
M2-F1 spurred interest in the Air Force as well, as some of its
officials, along with their NASA counterparts, set out to pursue
piloted lifting-body programs that would call for more than plywood
and funny cars. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">115</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA contracted with the firm of Northrop to
build two such aircraft, the M2-F2 and HL-10. The M2-F2 amounted to
an M2-F1 built to NASA standards; the HL-10 drew on an alternate
lifting-body design by Eugene Love of NASA-Langley. This meant that
both NASA-Langley and NASA-Ames would each have a project. In
addition to this, Northrop had a penchant for oddly-shaped aircraft.
During the 1940s, the company had built flying wingsthat essentially
were aircraft that without a fuselage or tail. With these
lifting-bodies, Northrop would build craft now that were entirely
fuselage and lacking wings. The Air Force project, the X-24A, went to
Martin Co., which built it as a piloted counterpart of PRIME,
maintaining the same shape. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">All three flew initially as gliders, with a
B-52 rather than a C-47 as the mother ship. The B-52 could reach
45,000 feet and 500 mph, four times the

FACE="Geneva"> It had routinely carried the X-15 aloft, acting as a
booster for that rocket plane; now it would do the same for the
lifting-bodies. Their shapes differed, and as with the M2-F1, a major
goal was to show that they could maintain stable flight while
gliding, land safely, and exhibit acceptable pilot handling
qualities. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">118</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These goals were not always met. Under the
best of circumstances, a lifting body flew like a brick at low speed.
Lowering the landing gear made the problem worse by adding drag. In
May 1967, the test pilot Bruce Peterson, flying the M2-F2, failed to
get his gear down in time. The aircraft hit the lake bed at more than
250 mph, rolled over six times, and then came to rest on its back,
minus its cockpit canopy, main landing gear, and right vertical fin.
Peterson, who might have died in the crash, got away with a skull
fracture, a mangled face, and the loss of an eye. While surgeons
reconstructed his face and returned him to active duty, the M2-F2
needed surgery of its own. In addition to an extensive reconstruction
back at the factory, Northrop engineers added a third vertical fin
that improved its handling qualities and made it safer to fly.
Similarly, while the rival HL-10 had its own problems of stability,
it flew and landed well after receiving modifications.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">119</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These aircraft were mounted with small rocket
engines that allowed acceleration to supersonic speeds. This made it
possible to test stability and handling qualities when flying close
to the speed of sound. The HL-10 set records for lifting-bodies by
making safe approaches and landings from speeds up to Mach 1.86 and
altitudes of 90,000 feet.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">120</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The Air Force
continued this work through 1975, having the Martin Co. rebuild the
X-24A with a long pointed nose, a design well-suited for supersonic
flight. The resulting craft, the X-24B, looked like a wingless
fighter-plane fuselage. It, also, flew well. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In contrast to the Navaho and X-15 efforts,
work with lifting-bodies did not create major new institutions or
lead existing ones in important new directions. This work, however,
did extend that of the X-15 with the hot-structure flights of ASSET
and the maneuvering reentries of PRIME. The piloted lifting-bodies
then demonstrated that, with the appropriate arrangements of
fins,....</FONT></P>

Boosters</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 and lifting-body programs
demonstrated many elements of a reusable launch vehicle in such
critical areas as propulsion, flight dynamics, structures, thermal
protection, configurations, instruments, and aircraft stability and
control. However, the reason for reusability would be to save money,
and an airplane-like orbiter would need a low-cost booster as a first
stage. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Navy, Air Force, and NASA laid
groundwork for such boosters by sponsoring pathbreaking work with
solid propellants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The path to such propellants can be traced
back to a struggling firm called Thiokol Chemical Corp. Its initial
stock-in-trade was a liquid polysulfide polymer that took its name
(Thiokol) from the Greek for "sulfur glue" and could be cured into a
solvent-resistant synthetic rubber. During World War II,
[<A NAME="43"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] it found limited use in sealing aircraft fuel tanks-a
market that disappeared after 1945. Indeed, business was so slow that
even small orders would draw the attention of the company president,
Joseph Crosby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When Crosby learned that California Institute
of Technology (CIT) was buying five- and ten-gallon lots in a steady
stream, he flew to California to investigate the reason behind the
purchases. He found a group of rocket researchers, loosely affiliated
with CIT, working at a place they called the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. They were mixing Crosby's polymer with an oxidizer and
adding powdered aluminum for extra energy. They were using this new
propellant in ways that would make it possible to build solid-fuel
rockets of particularly large size. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">122</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Crosby soon realized that he too could get
into the rocket business, with help from the Army. While Army
officials could spare only $250,000 per year to help him get started,
to Crosby this was big money. In 1950, Army Ordnance gave him a
contract to build a rocket with 5000 pounds of propellant. A year and
a half later it was ready, with a sign on the side, THE THING.
Fourteen feet long, it burned for over forty seconds and delivered a
thrust of 17,000 pounds. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">123</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The best solid propellants of the day were of
the "double base" type, derived from the explosives nitroglycerine
and nitrocellulose. Some versions could be cast in large sizes. These
propellants, however, burned in a sudden rush, and could not deliver
the strong, steady push needed for a rocket booster. The new
Thiokol-based fuel emerged as the first of a type that performed well
and burned at a reasonable rate. These fuels drew on polymer
chemistry to form as thick mixtures resembling ketchup. Poured into a
casing, they then polymerized into resilient rubbery solids.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">124</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Navy also took an interest in solid
propellants, initially for use in antiaircraft missiles. In 1954 a
contractor in suburban Virginia, Atlantic Research, set out to
achieve further performance improvements. Two company scientists,

use of powdered aluminum. Other researchers had shown that

five percent; higher levels caused a falloff. Undiscouraged, Rumbel
and Henderson decided to try mixing in really large amounts. The
exhaust velocity, which determines the performance of a rocket, took
a sharp leap upward. By early 1956, they confirmed this discovery
with test firings. Their exhaust velocities, 7400 feet per second and
greater, compared well with those of liquid fuels such as kerosene
and liquid oxygen. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">125</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then the Navy was preparing to proceed with
Polaris, a program that sought to send strategic missiles to sea
aboard submarines. Initial design concepts were unpleasantly large; a
submarine would be able to carry only four such missiles, and the
submarine itself would be excessive in size. The breakthrough in
propellants coincided with an important advance that markedly reduced
the weight of thermonuclear weapons. Lighter warheads meant smaller
missiles. These developments combined to yield a solid-fueled Polaris
missile that was very compact. Sixteen of them would fit into a
conventional-sized submarine. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">126</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="45"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">45</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The new propellants,
and the lightweight warheads, also drew interest within the Air
Force, though its needs contrasted sharply with those of the Navy.
Skippers could take time in firing undersea missiles, for a submarine
could hide in the depths until it was ready for launch. Admirals,
however, preferred solid fuels over liquids because they presented
less of a fire hazard. While the Air Force was prepared to use liquid
propellants in its ICBMs, these would take time to fuel and prepare
for launch-during that time they would lie open to enemy attack. With
solid propellants, a missile could be fueled in advance and ready for
instant launch. Moreover, such a missile would be robust enough to
fire from an underground chamber. Prior to launch, that chamber would
protect the missile against anything short of a direct nuclear
hit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lieutenant Colonel Edward Hall, who had
midwifed the birth of the Navaho during the 1940s, now played a
leading role in this newest project. He was the propulsion officer on
the staff of Major General Bernard Schriever who was responsible for
the development of the Atlas, Titan, and Thor. Hall developed a
passionate conviction that an Air Force counterpart of Polaris would
offer considerable advantage over the Soviet ICBM capability. At the
outset of the new project, he addressed the problem of constructing
very large solid-fuel charges, called grains. He could not draw on
the grains of the Polaris for that missile had grains of limited
size.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hall gave contracts to all of the several
solid-fuel companies that were in business at that time. Thiokol's
Crosby, who had lost the Polaris contract to Aerojet General, now saw
a chance to recoup. He bought a large tract of land near Brigham
City, Utah, a remote area where the shattering roar of rockets would
have plenty of room to die away. In November 1957, his researchers
successfully fired a solid-fuel unit with 25,000 pounds of
propellant, the largest to date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, Hall had taken charge of a working
group that developed a preliminary design for a three-stage
solid-fuel ICBM. Low cost was to be its strong suit, for Hall hoped
to deploy it in very large numbers. Early in 1958, with the test
results from Thiokol in hand, Hall and Schriever went to the Pentagon
and pitched the concept to senior officials, including the Secretary
of Defense. While the missile, named the Minuteman, might be launched
on a minute's notice, it would take most of 1958 to win high-level
approval for a fast pace of development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="46"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">46</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Barely two years
later, in early 1961, the Minuteman was ready for its first flight
from Cape Canaveral. It scored a brilliant success as all three
stages fired and the missile flew to full range. The Air Force
proceeded to raise the Minuteman to the status of a crash program.
The first missiles were operational in October 1962, in time for the
Cuban Missile Crisis. Realizing that its low cost made it the first
strategic weapon capable of true mass production, the Air Force went
on to deploy a 1,000 of the Minuteman rockets. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">127</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force and NASA actively prepared to
build solid-fuel boosters of truly enormous size for use with launch
vehicles. In contrast to liquid rockets that were sensitive and
delicate, the big solids featured casings that a shipyard -
specifically, the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, near
Philadelphia - would manufacture successfully.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Minuteman's first stage had a 60-inch
diameter. In August 1961, United Technology Corp. fired a 96-inch
solid rocket that developed 250,000 pounds of thrust. The following
year saw the first 120-inch tests-twice the diameter of the
Minuteman-that reached 700,000 pounds of thrust. The next milestone
was reached when the diameter was increased to 156 inches, the
largest size compatible with rail transport. During 1964, both
Thiokol and Lockheed Propulsion Co. fired test units that topped the
million-pound-thrust mark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Large rocket stages can be moved by barges
over water as well as by land. Aerojet was building versions with
260-inch diameters. It took some doing just to ignite such a
behemoth. The answer called for a solid rocket that itself developed
a quarter-million pounds of thrust, producing an eighty-foot flame
that would ignite the inner surface of the big one all at once. This
igniter rocket needed its own igniter, a solid motor that weighed a
hundred pounds and generated 4500 pounds of thrust. The 260-inch
motor was kept in a test pit with its nozzle pointing upward. In
February 1966, a night firing near Miami shot flame and smoke a mile
and a half into the air that was seen nearly a 100 miles away. In
June 1967, another firing set a new record with 5.7 million pounds of
thrust. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">128</FONT></SUP></B></P>

roughly a dollar per pound of thrust. This contrasted sharply with
the liquid-fueled Saturn V, which, with 7.5 million pounds of thrust
versus 6 million for the big solid, was in the same class. Even
without its Apollo moonship, however, the Saturn V cost $185 million
to purchase, over thirty times more than the 260-inch motor. By 1966,
NASA officials were looking ahead already to sizes as large as 600
inches, noting that "there is no fundamental reason to expect that
motors 50 feet in diameter could not be made." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">129</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, the Air Force not only was testing
big solids but it was preparing to use them operationally as part of
the Titan program which, in a decade, had evolved from building ICBMs
to assembling a launch vehicle of great power. At the outset, Titan I
was a two-stage ICBM project that ran in parallel with Atlas and used
similar engines in the first stage. While it was deployed as a
weapon, it was never used to launch a spacecraft or satellite.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">130</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The subsequent Titan II represented a major
upgrade as the engine contractor, Aerojet General, developed new
engines that markedly increased the thrust in both stages. It too
reached deployment, carrying a heavy thermonuclear warhead with a
yield of nine megatons. By lightening this load somewhat, the Titan
II was able to thrust a payload into orbit repeatedly. In particular,
during 1965 and 1966, the Titan II carried 10 piloted Gemini
spacecraft, each with two astronauts. Their weight ran above 8300
pounds. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">131</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force's Titan III added, to the Titan
II, a third stage (the "transtage") which enhanced its ability to
carry large payloads. Known as the Titan III-A, it never served as an
ICBM, but worked as a launch vehicle from the start. In particular,
it served as the core for the Titan III-C, which flanked that core
with a pair of 120-inch solid boosters. The rocket that resulted had
more than a casual resemblance to the eventual space shuttle, which
would use two somewhat larger solid boosters in similar fashion.
After lifting the Titan III-C with 2.36 million pounds of thrust,
these boosters then fell away after burnout, leaving the core to
ignite its first stage, high in the air.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Titan III-C had a rated payload of 23,000
pounds continued to increase. NASA replaced the transtage with the
more capable Centaur upper stage, which used liquid hydrogen as a
high-energy fuel. This version, the Titan III-E Centaur,.....</FONT>

Martin Marietta, the Titan III contractor, also proposed to delete
the third stage while increasing the thrust of both the solid
boosters and the core. This version, the Titan III-M, was never
built, but it would have lifted a payload of 38,000 pounds.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">132</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hence during the 1960s, the X-15, ASSET,
PRIME, lifting-body and solid-booster efforts all combined to provide
a strong basis for the space shuttle program. Such a program might
build an orbiter in the shape of a lifting body with a hot structure
for thermal protection. Piloted and crewed, it could maneuver during
atmosphere entry, ride through the heat of re-entry with its nose up,
then transition to gliding flight and fly to a landing, perhaps at
Edwards Air Force Base. Moreover, long before those early projects
had reached completion (and even before some of them were underway),
the Air Force set out to build a mini-shuttle that would ride a Titan
III-C to orbit and then return. This project was called Dyna-Soar
and, later, the X-20.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Dyna-Soar: A Failure in
Evolution</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the mid-1950s, with the Bomi studies of
Bell Aircraft in the background and the X-15 as an ongoing program, a
number of people eagerly carried out further studies that sought to
define the next project beyond the [<A NAME="50"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">50</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] X-15. The ideas
studied incorporated concepts from the Hywards project (a piloted
hypersonic boost-glide research aircraft), the Robo (Robot Bomber),
and two reconnaissance vehicles, the System 118-P and the Brass Bell.
With so many cooks in the kitchen, the Air Force needed a coordinated
program in order to produce something as specific as the X-15. Its
officials were in the process of defining this program when, in
October and November 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's
first satellites. Very quickly, hypersonic flight became one of the
means by which the U.S. might turn back the challenge from
Moscow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Having read the work of Sanger, hypersonic
specialists knew of his ideas for skipping entry as a way to extend
the range of a suborbital aircraft. The Air Force described this
maneuver as "dynamic soaring." The craft that would do this acquired
the name Dyna-Soar. By early 1958, this idea was being studied
seriously by a number of aeronautical contractors with the clear
understanding that the Air Force intended to request proposals and
build a flying prototype. In June 1958, the Air Force narrowed the
competition to two contenders: Boeing and a joint Bell Aircraft and
Martin Co. team. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">133</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then, Dyna-Soar was caught up in the first
round of a controversy as to whether this craft should be the
prototype of a bomber. While the powerful Air Research and
Development Command (ARDC) firmly believed that Dyna-Soar should be
the prototype of a piloted military spaceplane, it found it difficult
to point to specific military missions that such a craft could carry
out. For nuclear weapons delivery, the Air Force was already building
the Atlas, Titan, and Thor. For strategic reconnaissance, the Central
Intelligence Agency had launched, in 1958, a program that aimed to
build automated camera-carrying satellites and put the first ones
into orbit in as little as one year. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">134</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Air Force Headquarters, however, with support
from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, refused to consider
weapon-system objectives unless ARDC could define suitable military
missions. Early in 1959, Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Quarles
wrote that his approval was only "for a research and development
project and did not constitute recognition of Dyna-Soar as a weapon
system."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In April, the Defense Director of Research and
Engineering, Herbert York made a clear statement of the program's
objectives. Its primary goal [<A NAME="51"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] would involve
hypersonic flight up to a speed of 15,000 miles per hour, which would
fall short of orbital velocity. The vehicle would be piloted,
maneuverable, and capable of landing at a preselected base. York also
threw a bone to ARDC, stating that it could pursue its own goal of
testing military systems - provided that such tests did not detract
from the primary goal. ARDC officials hastened to affirm that there
would be no conflict. They promptly issued System Requirement 201,
stating that Dyna-Soar would "determine the military potential of a
boost-glide weapon system." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">135</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In November 1959, the contract award went to
Boeing. Two weeks later, the Air Force's Assistant Secretary for
Research and Development, Joseph Charyk, said "not so fast." He was
well aware that the project already faced strong criticism because of
its cost, as well as from Eisenhower Administration officials who
opposed space-based weapon systems. In addition to this, a number of
technical specialists doubted that the concept could be made to work.
Charyk therefore ordered a searching reexamination of the project
that virtually re-opened the earlier competition. In April 1960, the
Aerospace Vehicles Panel of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board
gave Dyna-Soar a go-ahead by approving Boeing's design concept, with
minor changes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the next three and a half years, the
program went forward as its managers reached for higher performance.
The 1960 plan called for the use of a Titan I as the launch vehicle.
Because the Titan II lacked the power to put it in orbit, the
Dyna-Soar would fly suborbital missions only. Over the next year and
a half, however, the choice of booster changed to the Titan II and
then the powerful Titan III-C. A new plan, approved in December 1961,
dropped suborbital flights and called for "the early attainment of
orbital flight, with the Titan III booster."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This plan called initially for single-orbit
missions that would not require the craft to carry an onboard
retro-rocket for descent from orbit. Instead the booster, launched
from Cape Canaveral, would place the craft on a trajectory that would
re-enter the atmosphere over Australia. It then would cross the
Pacific in a hypersonic glide, to land at Edwards Air Force Base. In
May 1962, the plan broadened anew to include multi-orbit flights.
Dyna-Soar now would ride atop the Titan III transtage that would
inject it into orbit and remain attached to serve as a retro-rocket
at mission's end. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The piloted Dyna-Soar spacecraft also emerged
with highly-swept delta wings and two upturned fins at the wingtips.
With a length of 35 feet, it lacked an onboard rocket engine and
provided room for a single pilot only. Like ASSET, it relied on
advanced hot structures, with a heat shield of columbium, well
insulated, atop a main structure built from a nickel alloy that had
been developed for use in jet engines. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">137</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> In September
1962, a full-scale mockup was the hit of the show at an Air Force
Association convention in Las Vegas. In addition to this, the Air
Force named six test pilots who would fly Dyna-Soar as its
astronauts. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">138</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="53"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The question of
military missions raised its head again when, in mid-1961, the new
Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara, directed the Air Force to justify
Dyna-Soar on military grounds. Air Force officials discussed orbital
reconnaissance, rescue, inspection of Soviet spacecraft, orbital
bombardment, and use of the craft as a ferry vehicle. While McNamara
found these reasons unconvincing, he nevertheless remained willing to
let the program proceed as a research effort, dropping all
consideration of a possible use of the craft as a weapon system. In
an October 1961 memo to President Kennedy, McNamara proposed to
"re-orient the program to solve the difficult technical problem
involved in boosting a body of high lift into orbit, sustaining man
in it and recovering the vehicle at a designated place."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">139</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This reorientation gave the project another
two years of life. With its new role as an experimental craft, it was
designated by Air Force Headquarters as the X-20. In this new role,
however, the program could not rely on a military justification; it
would have to stand on its value as research. By 1963, this value was
increasingly in question. ASSET, with its unpiloted craft, was
promising to demonstrate hypersonic gliding entry and hot-structure
technology at far lower cost. In the realm of piloted flight, NASA
now was charging ahead with its Gemini program. Air Force officials
were expected to participate in this program as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These officials still believed that their
service in time would build piloted spacecraft for military purposes.
In March 1963, McNamara ordered a study that would seek to determine
whether Gemini or the X-20 could better serve the role of a testbed
for military missions. The results of the study gave no clear reason
to prefer the latter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In October, Air Force officials, briefing the
President's Scientific Advisory Committee, encountered skepticism in
this quarter as well. Two weeks later, McNamara and other senior
officials received their own briefing. McNamara asked what the Air
Force intended to do with the X-20 after using it to demonstrate
maneuvering re-entry. He insisted he could not justify continuing the
project if it was a dead-end program with no ultimate purpose.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He canceled the program in December, stating
that the purpose of the program had been to demonstrate maneuvering
re-entry and precision landing. The X-20 was not to serve as a cargo
rocket, could not carry substantial payloads,
[<A NAME="54"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">54</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] and could not stay in orbit for long-duration
missions. He could not justify continuing with the program because it
was costly and would serve "a very narrow objective."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">140</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At that moment, the program, well past the
stage of paper studies, called for the production of 10 X-20
vehicles. Boeing had completed nearly 42 percent of the necessary
tasks. While McNamara's decision drew hot criticism, he had support
where it counted-the X-20 did not. Eugene Zuckert, the Air Force
Secretary, continued to endorse the program to the end, but the
project had little additional support among the Pentagon's civilian
secretaries. In the Air Force, the Space Systems Division (SSD) was
to conduct pilot training and carry out the flights. Support for the
X-20, however, was lukewarm both at the SSD and at Aerospace Corp.,
its source of technical advice. General Bernard Schriever, commander
of the ARDC,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">141</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> was also
lukewarm. So was his deputy commander for aerospace systems,
Lieutenant General Howell Estes. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">142</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Thus was the life and death of the Dyna-Soar.
From its demise one can draw the following conclusions. By 1963, the
program's technical feasibility was no longer in question; it was
just a matter of putting the pieces together. Although aerospace
vehicles were continuing to evolve at a rapid pace, no technical
imperative existed that could call the X-20 into existence. The
program needed a mission, a justification sufficiently compelling to
win political support from high-level officials. Dyna-Soar
demonstrated that even though the means were in hand to pursue the
development of a vehicle resembling the space shuttle, such a project
would stand or fall on its merits. To be built, it would require a
reason that capable of attracting and winning endorsement from
presidential appointees and other leaders at the highest
levels.</FONT></P>
