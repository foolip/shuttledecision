<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within NASA, Apollo addressed the concern that
Moscow's highly-publicized space spectaculars pointed to communism as
the way of the future. The Air Force had a separate space program
that dealt with the reality of power. Working closely with the CIA,
the Air Force had the task of launching reconnaissance satellites
that could determine the Soviet order of battle, counting that
nation's bombers and missiles while determining the location of their
bases and their operational readiness. In turn, these satellites
provided strategic intelligence that shaped America's Cold War
policies.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force in Space</FONT></I></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The background to the Air Force program dated
to 1953, shortly after the inauguration of President Eisenhower. In
August of that year, the Soviets [<A NAME="192"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">192</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] detonated a nuclear
weapon with a yield of 400 kilotons. By studying its fallout,
American analysts determined that it was not a true hydrogen bomb.
It, however, did represent a large step upward in Soviet nuclear
power. In addition to this, the CIA learned that the Soviets were
building a turboprop bomber, the Tu-95, with enough range to strike
the United States. An intelligence estimate, issued early in 1954,
predicted that Moscow would have 500 such bombers in 1957.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In March 1954, Eisenhower met with a group of
advisors and warned them that he feared a surprise attack, a new
Pearl Harbor that would destroy cities rather than battleships. Lee
DuBridge, the president of Caltech and chair of this advisory group,
he responded by taking steps to set up a high-level commission, the
Technological Capabilities Panel. It would recommend new policies
that could meet this danger. To chair it, Ike recruited James
Killian, the president of MIT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A subpanel, Project 3, dealt with the
technical means for surveillance. The people who learned of it
included Clarence "Kelly" Johnson of Lockheed, one of the country's
top aircraft designers. He had already prepared a design for a
reconnaissance aircraft and, without success, had tried to win
support from the Air Force. Johnson now joined with Trevor Gardner, a
special assistant to the Air Force secretary, and approached Project
3 for a new try. The subpanel's chairman, Edwin Land, had invented
the Polaroid camera and was president of the Polaroid Corporation. He
and Killian took the proposal to Ike and convinced him to accept it.
The plane that resulted was the U-2. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In mid-February 1955, the full Killian
Committee issued its report, titled "Meeting the Threat of Surprise
Attack." It declared, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We have an
offensive advantage but are vulnerable to surprise
attack"</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> (emphasis in original).
"Because of our vulnerability, the Soviets might be tempted to try an
attack." In Edwin Land's section of the report, he wrote, </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="193"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">193</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At the time, the
available "hard facts" were often meager. The 1953 Soviet nuclear
test had caught everyone by surprise. Then, on May Day of 1954, at a
public air show, the Soviets showed off a new jet bomber, the Bison.
Here was another surprise-a Soviet jet bomber. It was all the more
worrisome because no one in the U.S. had known of it until the
Kremlin displayed it openly. A year later, in preparations for the
next such air show, American observers saw a formation of 10 of these
aircraft in flight. In mid-July came the real surprise. On Aviation
Day, Colonel Charles Taylor, the U.S. air attach&eacute; in Moscow,
counted no fewer than 28 Bisons as they flew past a review in two
groups. This bomber now was obviously in mass production. The CIA
promptly estimated that up to 800 Bisons would be in service by
1960.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In fact, Taylor had seen an elaborate hoax.
The initial group of 10 Bisons had been real enough. They then had
flown out of sight, joined eight more, and this combined formation
had made the second flyby. Still, as classified estimates leaked to
the press, Senator Stuart Symington, a former Air Force Secretary,
demanded hearings and warned the nation of a "bomber gap." The flap
forced Ike to build more B-52 bombers than he had planned, and to
step up production of fighter aircraft in the bargain. Yet even when
analysts discovered the Aviation Day hoax, they took little comfort.
If Moscow was trying to fool the CIA, it might mean that the Soviets
were putting their real effort into missiles rather than bombers.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The U-2 became operational in mid-1956, and
proceeded to deliver photos of the highest value. One mission
returned with pictures that showed far fewer heavy bombers than
expected at Soviet bases. This started a process of downward revision
of Moscow's estimated air power. One of Ike's military aides declared
that "very quickly we found the Bomber Gap had a tendency to recede.
It was something that each year was going to occur. But in fact it
did not occur." The U-2 also looked at targets of opportunity, and
Richard Bissell, the project manager within the CIA, would recall an
example: "He was flying over Turkestan, and off in the distance he
saw something that looked quite interesting and that turned out to be
the Tyuratam launch site. He came back with the most beautiful photos
of this place." It was one of the [<A NAME="194"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">194</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] principal bases for
missile and space launches; yet the CIA had not known of its
existence. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, the U-2 delivered far less than
it had promised. When it entered service, Soviet radar promptly
picked it up. Following the second overflight, the Foreign Ministry
lodged a protest. The protests escalated, and after only six such
missions, all during July 1956, Ike ordered a standdown. Subsequent
flights required his personal approval; over the next four years,
only about 15 took place. Then, in May 1960, a Soviet antiaircraft
missile downed a U-2 near the city of Sverdlovsk. With this, the
overflights ceased completely. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then a new concern had arisen: the missile
gap. Early in 1960, a debate developed in Washington in response to a
new intelligence estimate, which predicted that Moscow would possess
up to 450 ICBMs in mid-1963. This would be twice America's
anticipated strength in missiles. This was frightening enough; deeper
skepticism was raised by the fact that the estimate actually
represented a substantial reduction from earlier ones. Senators
Symington and Johnson asked whether Ike perhaps was cooking the
books, downgrading the perceived threat during an election year.
Clearly the nation needed additional strategic reconnaissance, and
needed it quickly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then, the CIA's Bissell had been working
for nearly two years to address this problem. Early in 1958, he had
initiated a highly classified program, Corona, that sought to build
reconnaissance satellites known as Discoverer. These were to fly to
orbit atop Thor-Agena rockets. It took a year and a half, however, to
get the system to work successfully. The first attempt, Discoverer 1,
did not even reach orbit. Following launch from Vandenberg Air Force
Base in February 1959, it wound up near the South Pole. Finally, in
August 1960, Discoverer 13 proved the lucky 13 in the series. Though
it carried no photo equipment, it successfully demonstrated the
release of a capsule from orbit and its recovery in the Pacific. This
was the first spacecraft to reenter from orbit and be retrieved
following descent by parachute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With this encouragement, Bissell allowed
Discoverer 14 to fly with its camera. Its capsule, too, was recovered
successfully, this time in midair, on August 19. The film soon
arrived at the CIA's Photographic Interpretation Center, and the
photo interpreters gathered in an auditorium. The director,
[<A NAME="195"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">195</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] Arthur Lundahl, spoke to them about "something new
and great we've got here." His deputy then presented a map of the
Soviet Union. These maps had previously featured a single narrow line
to indicate the coverage along the path of a U-2. This one had eight
broad swaths running north to south across the USSR and Eastern
Europe, covering over one-fifth of their total area. They represented
the regions that this single mission had photographed, and people
broke out in cheers. Some photos were fogged by electrostatic
discharges, but the resolution was 20 to 30 feet, which analysts
described as "good to very good." Clearly, this was a turning point.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the election campaign that autumn,
Kennedy stressed the issue of the missile gap, warning that the
Republicans had done too little to counter its threat. After the
election, he appointed a deputy defense secretary, Roswell Gilpatric,
who believed strongly that this gap was real. On taking office in
January 1961, Gilpatric and his boss, Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara, went to the Air Force intelligence office on the fourth
floor of the Pentagon and spent several days personally studying
Discoverer photographs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force held the view that Moscow was
building large numbers of well-camouflaged missile sites. Sites for
the presumed disguised installations included a Crimean War memorial
and a medieval tower. McNamara and Gilpatric, however, preferred the
view of Army intelligence: that the Soviet ICBM, designated R-7, was
very large and unwieldy and could move only by rail or military road.
Discoverer satellites had taken photos along the Soviet Union's
railroads and principal highways-and had found no missile launchers.
In February, at an off-the-record press conference, a newsman asked
about the missile gap. McNamara replied that "there were no signs of
a Soviet crash effort to build ICBMs." Reporters raced to their
phones, newspapers blossomed with the word that no such gap existed,
and Kennedy himself had to step in, declaring that it was too early
to draw such conclusions. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then in June and July, Discoverers 25 and 26
flew with nearly complete success. While they were only the third and
fourth missions to return photos having intelligence value, together
these four flights covered more than half of the regions suitable for
ICBM deployment. Within this vast area, photo analysts found no more
than two new and previously unsuspected ICBM
[<A NAME="196"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">196</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] bases. Three others were photographed a second time.
By comparing them with one another, and with a known testing complex
at Tyuratam, the analysts came away with a clear understanding of
just what an ICBM base would look like. That made it possible to
eliminate a number of "suspect" launch sites and to give a clear and
definitive estimate of Moscow's ICBM strength.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This assessment, National Intelligence
Estimate 11-8/1-61, titled "Strength and Deployment of Soviet Long
Range Ballistic Missile Forces," came out on September 21. It
stated:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We now estimate that the present Soviet
   ICBM strength is in the range of 10-25 launchers from which
   missiles can be fired against the US, and that this force level
   will not increase markedly during the months immediately
   ahead.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The low present and near-term ICBM
   force probably results chiefly from a Soviet decision to deploy
   only a small force of the cumbersome, first generation ICBMs, and
   to press the development of a smaller, second generation system.
   On this basis, we estimate that the force level in mid-1963 will
   approximate 75-125 operational ICBM launchers.</FONT></I><FONT
   FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There indeed was a missile gap-but it favored
the United States, and by a large margin. In 1961, the U.S. was
already deploying substantial numbers of its first-generation Atlas,
Titan, Thor, and Jupiter missiles. In addition, the first Polaris
submarines were on station at sea. Beginning in October 1962, the
nation would also have the Minuteman ICBM, which would reach the
field in even larger numbers. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet it was hardly a secret in Moscow that the
Soviet R-7 was clumsy and unwieldy; that nation's planners had known
this from the start. Why, then, had they taken the trouble to develop
it? An answer was in hand, courtesy of Oleg Penkovskiy, a colonel in
the Chief Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet army. He had
recently begun working for MI-6, Britain's intelligence agency, and
had gone on to help the CIA as well. In May 1961, he delivered rolls
of microfilm that included minutes of Kremlin meetings in which
officials decided to use the R-7 for space launches, but not as an
ICBM.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="197"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">197</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At the outset of
the R-7 program, during the mid-1950s, Soviet officials had expected
to fire it from secret bases. This missile would take up to 20 hours
to fuel and prepare for launch, and during that time, it would be
highly vulnerable to attack. However, if the U.S. did not know where
these bases were located, the R-7 would remain safe. The advent of
American strategic reconnaissance upset this plan, by giving America
the intelligence needed to strike bases during pre-launch
preparations. The head of the Soviet strategic missile force, Marshal
Mitrofan Nedelin, accordingly decided to delay the deployment of a
large fleet of ICBMs until he could receive a more advanced version
that could be fueled and launched on short notice.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Corona program had sought to use
satellites to assess the Soviet threat. It did more; it markedly
reduced this threat, at least for a time, by piercing the secrecy
that formed a major element of Moscow's strategic calculations. Then,
as the 1960s proceeded, the Air Force and CIA, introducing a number
of important advances in the satellites, went on to fly them
routinely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Improved resolution was an early goal. The
cameras of 1961 achieved a resolution of 25 feet; better versions, in
service a year later, reached 10 feet. A further improvement, which
first flew in 1967, returned photos with resolution of six feet. To
make the best use of these increasingly sharp images, the 1962 and
later Discoverer satellites mounted dual cameras that could
photograph a site from different directions. This permitted
stereophotography, whereby analysts could study images that appeared
three-dimensional. Later versions of this spacecraft also carried
more film and stayed up longer. The first Discoverers had mission
times of a single day; subsequent models stretched this to three
weeks and longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The six-foot resolution represented a limit
for Discoverer. The Thor-Agena booster, used by the Discovere, had
only a modest payload capacity. Beginning in 1963, however, the Air
Force employed the Atlas-Agena and then the Titan III, which could
launch larger spacecraft with telescopes of greater acuity. These
rockets supported a separate program, Gambit, that achieved a
resolution of 18 inches. For the closest looks, the Air Force used
the closest orbits, with Gambit spacecraft dropping down to perigees
as low as 76 miles. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="198"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">198</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] What did Corona and
Gambit show? They photographed all Soviet ballistic-missile launch
complexes, following existing as well as new missiles through
development and deployment. In particular, they found and repeatedly
observed a major center at Plesetsk, near the northern city of
Arkhangelsk. Plesetsk specialized in launching reconnaissance
satellites and other military spacecraft. At its height, it accounted
for more than half of all space launches in the entire world, with
Tyuratam a distant second, and Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air
Force Base far behind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Corona also was first to see Severodvinsk, the
main construction site for ballistic-missile submarines. This made it
possible to monitor the launching of new classes of subs, and to
follow them through to operational deployment. The CIA also observed
the rapid growth of the Soviet surface navy. Coverage of aircraft
plants and air bases kept analysts up-to-date on bombers and
fighters, while other coverage allowed Army experts to learn the
nature of the tank forces that NATO would face if the Soviets were to
invade Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Corona photography uncovered the construction
of antiballistic-missile sites near Moscow and Leningrad, along with
the radar installations that supported them. Other photos located
antiaircraft batteries and made it possible for the Strategic Air
Command to find routes for its bombers that could avoid these
missiles. Specialized satellites, conducting geodetic mapping, became
the main source of data for the military charts of the Defense
Mapping Agency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As recently as the mid-1950s, the Soviets had
been able to fool the Americans concerning their air strength, and to
touch off a major Washington flap over a supposed "bomber gap,"
merely by flying the same aircraft around twice at an air show. By
contrast, a 1968 intelligence report contained the unequivocal
statement: "No new ICBM complexes have been established in the USSR
during the past year." As early as June 1964, Corona had photographed
all 25 of the complexes then in existence. If there had been any new
ones, the CIA would have seen them. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas divided up
the New World by drawing a line down the Atlantic, with Spain
claiming lands to the west of this line and
[<A NAME="199"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">199</FONT></B><FONT

</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">15</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> The activities of NASA and the Air Force lent
themselves to similar demarcation. With NASA emphasizing Apollo while
the Air Force dealt largely with satellite reconnaissance in low
orbit, there was little overlap between their concerns. However,
these two agencies did not run independent programs; there was a
great deal of cooperation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This cooperation was particularly strong in
the realm of launch vehicles. In launching automated spacecraft, the
most important such vehicles were derived from the Thor, Atlas, and
Titan ballistic missiles; both NASA and the Air Force used these
rockets repeatedly, and procured them from the same contractors. They
also shared in ongoing developments that increased their payload
capacities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As early as February 1961, an agreement
between NASA's James Webb and the Pentagon's Roswell Gilpatric
stipulated that neither agency would initiate the development of a
new launch vehicle without first seeking the consent of the other.
Then in 1962, a joint NASA-DoD Large Launch Vehicle Planning Group
issued a report that contained a recommendation: "The 120-inch
diameter solid motor and the Titan III launch vehicle should be
developed by the Department of Defense to meet DOD and NASA needs, as
appropriate in the payload range of 5000 to 30,000 pounds, low earth
orbit equivalent." 16</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Titan III brought the prospect of wasteful
duplication, for it competed directly with NASA's Saturn I-B. This
Saturn carried over 36,000 pounds to low orbit. The Titan III-C, the
first operational version, had a rated payload of 23,000 pounds; its
immediate successor, the Titan III-D, raised this to 30,000. In
addition to this, the projected Titan III-M promised to carry as much
as 38,000. Nevertheless, as early as 1967, the President's Science
Advisory Committee noted that "the launch costs of the [Saturn I-B]
are about double those of the Titan III-M." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because NASA was accustomed to receiving
launch vehicles that the Air Force had developed, it yielded
gracefully when the Saturn I-B came under pressure. NASA had
conducted the initial flight test of a Saturn-class first stage as
early as October 1961, at a time when the Titan III was still at the
level of preliminary study. In view of this early start, and because

to build 14 of them, though George Mueller hoped for more as he
pursued Apollo Applications. When budget cuts hit home, however, NASA
abandoned the Saturn I-B and turned to the Titan III-E Centaur. It
had the energy to launch large payloads on missions to Mars and the
outer planets, and did so repeatedly. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to launch vehicles, NASA turned to
the Air Force for facilities used for launch and tracking. When
NASA's rockets flew from Cape [<A NAME="201"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">201</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Canaveral, they
proceeded down the Eastern Test Range-which the Air Force operated.
That service provided tracking stations, and when NASA built stations
of its own on the islands of Antigua and Ascension, they were
co-located near those of the Defense Department.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force also built up an extensive array
of launch facilities at Cape Canaveral. When NASA took over nearly
exclusive use of some of them, the Air Force transferred them to NASA
outright. These included Launch Complex 12 for Atlas-Agena, LC 36 for
Atlas-Centaur, and LC 19 for the Titan II. Other launch pads served
both agencies: LC 17 for Delta, LC 41 for Titan III. In addition to
this, NASA launched early versions of Saturn, including the Saturn
I-B, from LC 34 and 37, which had been built on land owned by the Air
Force.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The two agencies also cooperated closely in
research. The Air Force had a valuable set of wind tunnels and
engine-test facilities at its Arnold Engineering Development Center
in Tennessee. This service, however, did not attempt to duplicate the
far more extensive facilities of NASA-Ames, Langley, and Lewis. In
addition to a broad array of supersonic wind tunnels, NASA offered
such unique installations as a wind tunnel at Ames Research Center
with a 40 by 80-foot cross section, big enough to hold and test
full-size fighter aircraft. At NASA-Langley, a 60-foot vacuum sphere
could accommodate large spacecraft and rocket stages.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to sharing facilities, NASA and
the Air Force also pursued joint ventures in research. The X-15 was
one; another, the XB-70, involved large aircraft that could fly at
Mach 3. The agencies also collaborated in building immense
solid-propellant rockets. At Edwards Air Force Base, NASA built test
stands for rocket engines used in Apollo. These complemented earlier
Air Force test facilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Institutional arrangements also bound them
closely. Between 1958 and 1964, NASA and the Defense Department
executed some 88 major agreements. A joint Aeronautics and
Astronautics Coordinating Board (AACB) dealt with such areas as
aeronautical research, launch vehicles, spacecraft, and piloted space
flight. NASA's Deputy Administrator and the DoD's Director of Defense
Research and Engineering co-chaired this board; as early as 1966, an
AACB subpanel carried out an important review of concepts for
reusable launch vehicles.</FONT></P>

interagency cooperation would only go so far. In August 1963, Webb
and McNamara signed an agreement that sought "to ensure that in the
national interest complete coordination is achieved" in pursuing a
joint space-station project. Only a month later, McNamara sent Webb a
follow-up letter that expressed his reservations. Then in December,
McNamara made it clear that at least for the short term, the Air
Force would want a piloted orbital facility of its own.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When he canceled Dyna-Soar, on December 10, he
handed the Air Force a consolation prize by inviting that service to
conduct studies of a new project, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory
(MOL). MOL took shape as a cylinder, 10 feet across by 41 feet long,
with a Gemini spacecraft at one end; this ensemble was to ride to
orbit atop a Titan III. McNamara could not grant formal approval for
MOL; that had to come from the White House, and this raised anew the
question of what the Air Force might do with such a facility. While
that service had failed to provide good justification for Dyna-Soar,
this time it came up with a fine reason for MOL: strategic
reconnaissance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The eventual plan called for MOL to carry a
telescope with aperture of six feet, offering resolution of nine
inches. Astronauts would avoid photographing cloud-covered regions,
but would scan the ground with binoculars, looking for items of
interest. The Air Force won support from such key figures as Kermit
Gordon, director of the Budget Bureau, and Donald Hornig, the White
House science advisor. In August 1965, President Johnson gave MOL his
endorsement, which meant it could go forward to contract award and
development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By then George Mueller was nurturing hopes for
Apollo Applications, which raised anew the prospect of duplication.
NASA officials, unwilling to affront the Air Force, supported MOL and
took the view that it was not the national space station contemplated
in the 1963 Webb-McNamara agreement. Nevertheless, members of
Congress as well as Budget Bureau officials soon were asking whether
NASA could adopt a version of MOL for its own use.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In January 1966, Senator Clinton Anderson,
chairman of the Senate space committee, sent a letter to Webb that
recommended use of MOL. Within the House, the Military Operations
Subcommittee criticized Mueller's plan for "unwarranted duplication"
and called for MOL to proceed as a joint
NASA-[<A NAME="204"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">204</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Air Force
program-with the Air Force in charge. Budget Bureau officials also
supported a common program. In February 1967, the President's Science
Advisory Committee added its own views, calling for "maximum
utilization" of MOL and calling on NASA to carefully consider its use
"before substantial funds are committed" to Apollo
Applications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA responded by having Douglas Aircraft, the
MOL prime contractor, evaluate the suitability of MOL for NASA's
objectives. The agency also conducted in-house studies. These began
by acknowledging that the Saturn I-B was far more costly than the
Titan III, and considered whether it might be advantageous to have
the latter launch Apollo spacecraft. The OMSF concluded that while
this was possible, it would cost $250 million to develop such a
Titan-Apollo, which would then require 17 launches before the savings
surpassed the initial cost of conversion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The OMSF also concluded that MOL was too small
for NASA's needs. It was no larger than a house trailer, whereas
Mueller had described his proposed wet workshop as being the size of
"a small ranch house." While the Air Force had a proposal in hand for
a larger MOL, this would cost an additional $480 million and would
take four years to develop. In comparison, even the Saturn I-B would
cost less to use. These arguments mollified the critics, and Apollo
Applications went forward, though with a reduced budget.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">MOL also went forward, with strong Pentagon
support. The Air Force, however, never having carried through the
development of a piloted spacecraft, failed to control its cost.
Between 1965 and 1969, the projected cost of MOL ballooned from $1.5
billion to $3 billion. During those same years, the escalating
Vietnam War placed military programs under severe strain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The future of MOL came up for discussion at a
White House meeting between Nixon, national security advisor Henry
Kissinger, and Budget Bureau director Robert Mayo. Though the program
carried the strong endorsement of Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it proved to lack support from a key
official: Richard Helms, Director of Central Intelligence and head of
the CIA. In the words of the analyst Jeffrey Richelson, Helms's
advisers "feared that an accident that cost the life of a single
astronaut might ground the program for an extended period of time and
cripple the reconnaissance program."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="205"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">205</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Mayo suggested
canceling MOL; Nixon and Kissinger agreed. Only then did Mayo discuss
the matter with Laird, who had not even believed that MOL was in
trouble. Though Laird appealed directly to Nixon, emphasizing that
the Joint Chiefs firmly supported this program, Nixon turned him
down. The public announcement of the end of MOL came on June 10,
1969, with its first piloted flight still three years in the future.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the 1960s, the Air Force pursued two
major and separate efforts-Dyna-Soar and MOL-that sought to place
military astronauts in orbit. This service ended the decade with both
projects canceled and with nothing to show for its efforts. Clearly,
if it was to send such astronauts aloft, it would not do so on its
own, but would have to work in cooperation with NASA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, the experiences of the
Titan III, the Saturn I-B, MOL, and Apollo Applications, had shown
clearly that these agencies could easily introduce wasteful
duplication by pursuing their own programs. This made it plausible
that a cooperative NASA-Air Force program, focusing on piloted flight
to orbit, would take shape as a national program, a unified effort
shaped to serve the needs of both agencies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Clearly, Air Force involvement would emphasize
strategic reconnaissance, which represented the main rationale for
that service's activities in space. The experience of MOL, however,
showed that it would not do simply to propose that astronauts could
operate telescopes and cameras from orbit. Instead, the Air Force
would have to use piloted flight to support its work with automated
reconnaissance satellites, such as those of Corona and Gambit.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As early as 1963, NASA and the Air Force had
executed the Webb-McNamara agreement, which contemplated a joint
space station. With MOL now canceled, it was difficult to see how the
Pentagon could justify major participation in the space station that
NASA's Tom Paine wanted so badly. The Space Shuttle was another
matter. By launching, retrieving, and servicing spacecraft, it might
significantly enhance the ability of the Air Force to conduct
strategic reconnaissance. In turn, by serving Air Force needs, the
Shuttle might indeed take shape as a truly national system, carrying
military as well as civilian payloads. Beginning in 1969, the
evolution of the Space Shuttle concept took a sharp turn in this
direction.</FONT></P>

FACE="Geneva">A New Shuttle Configuration</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When a new round of shuttle design studies got
under way, early in 1969, the field had seen no truly new concept
since Max Hunter's partially-reusable Star Clipper of several years
earlier. While work went forward at the contractors, Max Faget, at
the Manned Spacecraft Center, carried through a parallel effort of
his own that indeed came up with a new approach. His configuration
not only went on to dominate the alternatives; it changed the terms
of the ongoing discussions. These discussions had emphasized such
issues as full versus partial reusability, with neither approach
finding expression in a generally-accepted design concept. Faget now
introduced a specific concept: a two-stage fully-reusable shuttle. As
it gained acceptance, it spurred debate over its specific features,
notably size, payload capacity, and choice of wing design. By
focusing the debate, Faget's work thus narrowed the topics that
subsequent studies would address, and enabled these studies to
achieve greater depth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faget was an aerodynamicist who had built his
career at NACA's Langley Aeronautical Laboratory. He was a member of
the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, an early nucleus of
activity in high speed flight. In 1954, he took part in an initial
feasibility study that led to the X-15. He then found a point of
departure for his subsequent career in the findings of his fellow
NACA aerodynamicists, H. Julian Allen and Alfred Eggers. They had
shown that for a reentering nose cone, a blunt shape would provide
the best protection against the heat of reentry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Working with a longtime associate, Caldwell
Johnson, Faget proceeded to devise a suitable blunt shape for Project
Mercury, which put America's first astronauts in orbit. His Mercury
capsule took shape as a cone, with its broad end forward and covered
with a thick layer of material to provide thermal protection. (A
cutaway view of this concept, elegantly rendered, hangs in Faget's
offices to this day.) He came to Houston as a founding member of the
Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), where he became Director of Research
and Engineering. He also adapted his basic shape to provide capsules
for Gemini and Apollo. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"My history has always been to take the most
conservative approach," he declares. In this frame of mind, he
disliked much of the work done to date on Space Shuttle concepts.
Lifting-body configurations were popular; Lockheed's Max Hunter had
used them in his Star Clipper. Faget acknowledged their merits: "You
avoid wing-body interference," which brings problems of aerodynamics.
"You have a simple structure. And you avoid the weight of wings." He
saw difficulties, however, that were so great as to rule out lifting
bodies for a practical shuttle design.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">They had low lift and high drag, which meant a
dangerously high landing speed. As he put it, "I don't think it's
charming to come in at 250 knots." Engineers at McDonnell Douglas,
studying their Tip Tank lifting body, had tried to improve the
landing characteristics by adding small wings that would extend from
the body during the final approach. This appeared as very
makeshift.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because they required a fuselage that would do
the work of a wing, lifting bodies also promised serious difficulties
in development. It would not be possible.... </FONT></P>

straightforward ways; the attempted solutions would ramify throughout
the entire design. In his words, "They're very difficult to develop,
because when you try to solve one more problem, you're creating
another problem somewhere else." His colleague Milton Silveira, who
went on to head the MSC Shuttle Engineering Office, held a similar
view: </FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">If we had a problem with the
   aerodynamics on the vehicle, where the body was so tightly coupled
   to the aerodynamics, you couldn't simply go out and change the

   mistake, being able to correct it was a very difficult thing to
   do.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">26</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Instead, Faget proposed to build each of his
shuttle's two stages as a winged airplane, with thermal protection on
the underside. Before it could fly as an airplane, such a shuttle
would first have to reenter, which meant it
[<A NAME="209"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">209</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] would need the high drag of a blunt body. "With
extremely high drag," he notes, "you throw a big shock wave in front
of you, and all the energy goes into that shock." Even with thermal
protection, he did not want to fly his shuttle during reentry, in the
manner of an airplane: "It's a hell of a lot easier to do a no-lift
entry than a lifting entry, from the standpoint of heat protection."
With airplane-style reentry, "you are stuck in the atmosphere, going
fast for a long time." Rather than lose energy to a shock wave, the
airplane would experience drag through friction with the atmosphere
which would transfer heat to its surface.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faget expected to turn his airplane into a
blunt body by the simple method of having it reenter at a very high
angle of attack, with its broad lower surface facing the direction of
flight. In effect, he would take an Apollo capsule, with its large
circular heat shield, and trim it to the shape of an airplane with
wings. This concept drew on the experience of the X-15 that looked
like a fighter plane but reduced its reentry heating by coming in
nose-high. It also revived a design approach introduced a decade
earlier by NASA's Charles Mathews. He had also proposed to build a
winged spacecraft as a glider that would reenter with its bottom side
facing forward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faget wrote that "the vehicle would remain in
this flight attitude throughout the entire descent to approximately
40,000 feet, where the velocity will have dropped to less than 300
feet per second. At this point, the nose gets pushed down, and the
vehicle dives until it reaches adequate velocity for level flight."
This dive would cost some 15,000 feet of altitude. The craft then
would approach a runway and land at a moderate 130 knots, half the
landing speed of a lifting body.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faget wrote that because its only real flying
would take place during this landing approach, a wing design "can be
selected solely on the basis of optimization for subsonic cruise and
landing." The wing best suited to this limited purpose would be
straight and unswept, like the wings of fighter planes in World War
II. A tail would provide directional stability, again as with a
conventional airplane. By moving control surfaces on the horizontal
stabilizer, a pilot then could raise the nose slightly just before
touching down on a runway, in a maneuver called a flare which adds
lift and makes the touchdown gentle. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="210"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">210</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Faget's concept had
the beauty of simplicity, and, inevitably, knowledgeable specialists
would criticize it as being too simple. The Air Force Flight Dynamics
Laboratory (FDL), at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, quickly emerged
as a center of such criticism. The FDL had sponsored space shuttle
studies in parallel with those of NASA, and had investigated such
concepts as Lockheed's Star Clipper. One of its managers, Charles
Cosenza, had been a leader in the development of ASSET. Another FDL
scientist, Alfred Draper, was a leader in the field of space systems.
Beginning in early 1969, he took the initiative in questioning
Faget's approach. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">28</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Draper did not accept the idea of building a
shuttle as an airplane that would come in nose-high, then dive
through 15,000 feet to pick up flying speed. With its nose so high,
the plane would be fully stalled, and the Air Force disliked both
stalls and dives, regarding them as preludes to an out-of-control
crash. Draper preferred to have the Shuttle enter its glide while
still supersonic, thus maintaining much better control while
continuing to avoid aerodynamic heating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If the Shuttle was to glide across a broad
Mach range, from supersonic to subsonic, then it would encounter an
important aerodynamic problem: a shift in the wing's center of lift.
Although a wing generates lift across its entire lower surface, one
may regard this lift as concentrated at a point, the center of lift.
At supersonic speeds, this center is located midway down the wing's
chord (the distance from leading to trailing edge). At subsonic
speeds, this center shifts and moves forward, much closer to the
leading edge. Keeping an airplane in proper balance requires the
application of an aerodynamic force that can compensate for this
shift.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force had extensive experience with
supersonic fighters and bombers that had successfully addressed this
problem, maintaining good control and handling characteristics from
Mach 3 to touchdown. Particularly for large aircraft-the B-58 and
XB-70 bombers, and the SR-71-the preferred solution was a delta wing,
triangular in shape. Typically, delta wings ran along much of the
length of the fuselage, extending nearly to the tail. Such aircraft
dispensed with horizontal stabilizers and relied instead on elevons,
control surfaces resembling ailerons set at the wing's trailing edge.

elevons then compensated for the shift in the center of lift,
maintaining proper trim and balance without imposing excessive drag.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Draper proposed that both stages of Faget's
shuttle should feature delta wings, rather than straight ones. Faget
would have none of this. Though he acknowledged the center-of-lift
problem, he expected to avoid it: "The straight wing never flew at
those speeds; it fell at those speeds." A delta wing with elevons
promised problems at landing, when executing the flare prior to
touchdown. That flare was to add lift, but raising the elevons would
increase the drag-with the added lift coming only after the nose had
time to come up. This momentary rise in drag would make the landing
tricky and possibly dangerous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To achieve a suitably slow landing speed,
Faget argued that the delta wing would need a large wingspan. A
straight wing, having narrow chord, would be light and would offer
relatively little area demanding thermal protection. A delta of the
same span, necessary for a moderate landing speed, would be
physically much larger than the straight wing. It would add
considerable weight, and would greatly increase the area that would
receive thermal protection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Draper responded with his own viewpoint. For a
straight wing to deal with the shift in center of lift, a good
engineering solution would call for installation of canards, small
wings mounted well forward on the fuselage that would deflect to give
the desired control. Canards produce lift, and would tend to push the
main wings farther to the back. These wings would be well aft from
the beginning, for they would support an airplane that was empty of
fuel but that had heavy rocket engines at the tail, placing the
airplane's center of gravity far to the rear. The wings' center of
lift was to coincide closely with this center of gravity. Draper
wrote that the addition of canards "will move the wings aft and tend
to close the gap between the tail and the wing." The wing shape that
fills this gap is the delta; Draper added that "the swept delta would
most likely evolve."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The delta also had other advantages as well.
Being thick where it joins the fuselage, it would readily offer room
for landing gear. Its sharply-swept leading edge meant that a delta
would produce less drag than a straight wing near Mach 1. In addition
to this, when decelerating through the sound barrier, a delta would
shift its center of lift more slowly. The combination of a sudden
drag rise near Mach 1, combined with a rapid center-of-lift shift,
would [<A NAME="213"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">213</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] produce a sudden
and potentially disconcerting change in the stability characteristics
of a straight-winged shuttle when slowing through the speed of sound.
This change in stability would be much less pronounced with a delta,
and would give a pilot more time to react. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The merits of deltas might have remained a
matter for specialists for another important feature of the delta:
Compared to the straight wing, it produced considerably more lift at
hypersonic speeds. Using this lift, a reentering shuttle could
achieve a substantial amount of crossrange, flying large distances to
the left or right of an initial direction of flight. The Air Force
wanted plenty of crossrange, and the reasons involved its activity in
strategic reconnaissance. In particular, these reasons drew on recent
experience involving the Six-Day War in the Middle East in 1967, and
the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Six-Day War broke out suddenly, pitting
Israel against a coalition led by Egypt whose tanks and aircraft came
largely from the Soviet Union. Though America's intelligence
community sought to follow the fighting closely, its means proved to
be limited. A ship near the Israeli coast, the </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">USS Liberty</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, monitored
the communications of the belligerents-until the Israelis bombed it.
Though spy planes, such as the U-2 and SR-71, could look down through
clear desert skies, experience had shown that the U-2 was vulnerable
to antiaircraft missiles. Satellite reconnaissance relied on Gambit
and Corona, which had been designed to follow the slow development
and deployment of missiles and other strategic weapons. They were not
well-suited to the swift battle maneuvers of the 1967 war, and
Defense Secretary McNamara does not recall that these spacecraft
played any role in U.S. intelligence-gathering during those six days.
By the time Corona photography became available, the war was over
already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then, in August 1968, the Soviets stormed into
Prague. A Gambit spacecraft, launched on August 6, performed poorly
and was deorbited before the invasion took place. In addition to
this, the CIA had a Corona satellite that entered orbit on August 7.
It carried two capsules for film return. The first one appeared
reassuring; it showed no indications of Soviet preparations for an
attack. The second capsule returned photos that clearly showed such
[<A NAME="214"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">214</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] preparations, including massing of troops. By the
time that film reached Washington, however, those photos were of
historical interest only. The invasion had already taken place.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Clearly, the CIA needed real-time space
reconnaissance, and its pursuit of this goal would represent one more
instance wherein a task originally thought to require astronauts
would be accomplished using automated electronics. The true solution
would lie in doing away with photographic film, which took time to
expose and return. This film would give way to a new electronic
microchip called a charge-coupled device. With an image focused onto
this chip, it would convert the image into a rapid series of bits.
The data, transmitted to the ground, would give the desired real-time
photography, and with very high resolution. In addition to this, by
freeing reconnaissance satellites from the need to carry and return
film, this invention would allow such spacecraft to remain in orbit
and to operate for years. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The charge-coupled device grew out of the work
of two specialists at Bell Labs, William Boyle and George Smith. In
1969, such technology still lay in the future. The view in the Air
Force was that the CIA would need piloted spacecraft to produce the
real-time photos. The late lamented MOL had represented a possible
method, for an onboard photointerpreter might take, develop, and
analyze photos on short notice. Now, with MOL in its graveyard,
attention turned to the Space Shuttle. It might fly into space,
execute a single orbit, and return to its base with film exposed less
than an hour earlier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Because much of the Soviet Union lies above
the Arctic Circle, the Air Force was accustomed to placing
reconnaissance satellites into polar orbits. It could not do this by
firing its boosters from Cape Canaveral; geography dictated that
these boosters would fly over populated territory. A launch to the
north carried the hazard of impact in the Carolinas; a launch to the
south would compromise security if the rocket fell on Cuba. Hence,
the Air Force maintained its own space center at Vandenberg AFB, on
the California coast. It offered a clear shot to the south, across
thousands of miles of open ocean. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">33</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While a satellite orbit remains fixed in
orientation with respect to distant stars, the earth rotates below
this orbit. This permitted single reconnaissance missions to
photograph much of the Soviet Union. However, it meant that if
[<A NAME="215"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">215</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] a shuttle was to execute a one-orbit mission from
Vandenberg, it would return to the latitude of that base after 90
minutes in space only to find that, due to the earth's rotation, this
base had moved to the east by 1100 nautical miles. Air Force
officials indeed expected to launch the Shuttle from Vandenberg, and
they insisted that the Shuttle had to have enough crossrange to cover
that distance and return successfully.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force had other reasons to want
once-around missions. Its planners were intrigued by the idea of
using the Shuttle to retrieve satellites in orbit. They hoped to
snare Soviet spacecraft in such a fashion-and because Moscow might
defend such assets by deploying an antisatellite weapon, the Air
Force took the view that if the thing was to be done at all, it was
best to do it quickly. A once-around mission could snare such a
spacecraft and return safely by the time anyone realized it was
missing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, NASA and the Air Force
shared a concern that a shuttle might have to abort its mission and
come down as quickly as possible after launch. This might require
"once-around abort," which again would lead to a flight of a single
orbit. A once-around abort on a due-east launch from Cape Canaveral
would not be too difficult; the craft might land at any of a number
of sites within the United States. In the words of NASA's Leroy Day,
"If you were making a polar-type launch out of Vandenberg, and you
had Max's straight-wing vehicle, there was no place you could go.
You'd be in the water when you came back. You've got to go crossrange
quite a few hundred miles in order to make land."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force had ample opportunity to
emphasize its desire for crossrange by working within the Joint Study
Group that Paine and Seamans had set up to seek a mutually-acceptable
shuttle design. There were informal discussions as well. George
Mueller, who continued to head NASA's OMSF through the whole of 1969,
met repeatedly with Air Force representatives at his home in
Georgetown, close to downtown Washington. One of his guests was
Michael Yarymovych, an Air Force deputy assistant secretary. Another
guest, Grant Hansen, was assistant secretary for research and
development. He and Mueller also were co-chairmen of the joint study.

leaders knew that they held the upper hand. They were well aware that
NASA needed a shuttle program and therefore needed both the Air

boosters such as the Titan III. "Sure, NASA needs the shuttle for the
space station," Hansen said in the spring of 1970. "But for the next
10 years, expendables can handle the Air Force job. We don't consider
the Shuttle important enough to set money aside for it."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was not that simple, of course; no
impromptu discussion in Mueller's home would settle such an issue.
Rather, it was a matter for the formal protocols of Air Force-NASA
cooperation. There was strong conflict between these agencies'
wishes, for a NASA baseline document of June 1969, "Desired System
Characteristics," emphasized that NASA needed only 250 to 400 n.mi.

double dose of additional thermal protection, resulting in a shuttle
that would be heavier-and more costly. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even in its simple straight-wing form, Faget's
concept of a two-stage fully-reusable shuttle did not take NASA by
storm. It won its pre-eminence only after a process of review and
evaluation that extended through 1969 and into 1970. The framework
for this process involved the contractors' studies of shuttle
configurations that had begun early in 1969. Those studies ruled out
expendable boosters for a reusable shuttle, for such boosters were
found to exceed the Saturn V in size. Fully- and partially-reusable
shuttle concepts [<A NAME="218"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">218</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] remained in the
running, and Faget's concept counted as a new example of the former.
NASA proceeded to examine it alongside several alternatives,
beginning in mid-1969.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The initial round of studies, during the first
half of 1969, had come to $1.2 million, divided equally among four
contractors. NASA now extended these studies by giving $150,000 more
to each of three contractors, with McDonnell Douglas receiving
$225,000. The participating companies also received new instructions
that redirected their work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American Rockwell had examined
expendable boosters. With this approach now out of favor, this firm
was free to direct its attention to something new. This proved to be
Faget's straight-wing concept, largely in the form he
recommended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">McDonnell Douglas, which had examined its Tip
Tank stage-and-a-half design, now switched to two-stage
fully-reusables. These, however, were not Faget's, but rather
continued an earlier line of work. They featured orbiter designs
derived from the HL-10 lifting body, with this contractor's engineers
considering 13 possible configurations for the complete two-stage
vehicle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At first, the other two contractors saw little
change in their assignments. Lockheed was to continue with studies of
Star Clipper and of its own version of the Triamese. General
Dynamics, home of the initial Triamese concept, was to study variants
of this design, and would also apply its background to design a
fully-reusable concept having only two elements rather than the three
of Triamese.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The orders for this redirection went out on
June 20, 1969. Within weeks, the studies brought a flurry of activity
that further narrowed the admissible choices. Expendable boosters had
already fallen by the wayside. On August 6, a meeting of shuttle
managers brought a decision to drop all partially-reusable systems as
well. With this, both Lockheed's Star Clipper and McDonnell Douglas's
Tip Tank were out. This decision meant that NASA would consider only
fully-reusable concepts. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Partially-reusable designs had represented an
effort to meet economic goals by seeking a shuttle that would cost
less to develop than a fully-reusable system, even while imposing
higher costs per flight. This approach had held promise prior to the

include launches of automated spacecraft, which meant it might fly
far more often. The low cost per flight of a fully-reusable now made
it attractive, and encouraged NASA to accept its higher development
cost. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">40</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were at least five ways to build a
fully-reusable shuttle, and NASA had appropriate designations and
descriptions:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">FR-1</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">: the
Triamese;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">FR-2</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">: a
two-stage vehicle with the engines of both stages ignited at

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">FR-3</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">: a
two-stage vehicle with engines in the orbiter ignited only upon
staging (Faget's shuttle was an FR-3; so were the concepts of
McDonnell Douglas);</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">FR-4</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">: a
variant of the Triamese with the core stage not of the same length as
the twin booster stages;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">FR-5</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">: a
concept designed to avoid a shift in its center of gravity as its
propellant tanks would empty, thus easing problems of stability and
control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="220"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">220</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] On September 4,
another meeting eliminated the Triamese configurations. The initial
concept, the FR-1, had called for three elements of common length and
structural design. It had proven difficult, however, to have one
shape serve both as booster and orbiter; to Silveira, "it gets all
screwed up, so you get a lousy orbiter and a lousy booster, but you
don't get one that does well." Advocates of the Triamese had turned
to the FR-4, with its unequal-length design. This, however, proved
heavier than the FR-3, while requiring two booster elements rather
than one. It also lost much of the potential cost saving from design
commonality between the three elements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The FR-3 and FR-5 remained. The latter had few
advocates; the problem of center-of-gravity shift was not so severe
as to call for the design innovations of this class of concepts. The
manager Max Akridge writes, "It was felt at this time that clearly,
the FR-3 configuration was the forerunner." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">41</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These decisions brought a further redirection
in the studies, for while North American Rockwell had gotten an early
start on Faget's concept, the other three contractors had to change
course. McDonnell Douglas, having found no advantage in its
lifting-body orbiters, turned to winged orbiters resembling those of
Faget.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Lockheed also turned to the FR-3, it did
not embrace Faget's concept wholeheartedly. This company had spent
several years studying Star Clipper, which featured a lifting-body
orbiter, triangular in shape. This now looked like a good way to meet
Air Force crossrange requirements, and Lockheed's new design retained
this lifting body, with a broad underside in the shape of a
delta.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">General Dynamics showed its own individuality.
That firm had designed its Triamese with retractable wings, which
would fold into the body during flight but swing outward for landing.
This eased the problem of providing these wings with thermal
protection, because the fuselage would shield them. This feature now
reappeared in the company's new FR-3. It drew on more than Triamese;
it also reflected company experience with swinging wings. These were
part of the F-111 fighter-bomber, which swung its wings to achieve
good performance in both subsonic and supersonic
flight.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">42</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="221"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">221</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Hence, by the end
of 1969 NASA had settled on the FR-3 as its choice, with Faget's
specific concept in the forefront. This raised important questions
concerning thermal protection. The booster was to be as large as a
Boeing 747, yet was to outperform the X-15, reaching considerably
higher speeds. The orbiter would be longer than a Boeing 707. For
both, the thermal protection had to be reusable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the industry, a standard engineering
solution called for the use of hot structures. This approach had a
background that included the X-15, Dyna-Soar, ASSET, as well as the
Lockheed SR-71 that was flying routinely above Mach 3. Hot structures
typically called for titanium as the basic material, covered with
high temperature insulation and an outer skin formed of metallic
shingles. The metal was molybdenum or columbium, to withstand extreme
temperatures while radiating away the heat. Like the shingles on a
roof, those on the surface of a hot structure were loosely attached,
to expand and contract freely with temperature change.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such structures were complex, and the shingles
posed difficulties of their own. Columbium and molybdenum oxidize
readily when hot, and required coatings to resist this. The Dyna-Soar
had been designed to use such thermal protection, and Faget declared
that "the least little scratch in the coating, the shingle would be
destroyed during re-entry." In turn, lost shingles could bring the
loss of a vehicle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA and Lockheed now were developing a new
surface material: an insulation made of interlaced fibers of silica
that could be applied to the outside of a vehicle. These could
withstand temperatures of 2500 degrees Fahrenheit, making them
suitable for all but the hottest areas on a reentering shuttle. The
outer surface would radiate away the heat, in the fashion of the
shingles. The thickness of the silica then would prevent most of the
heat from reaching the vehicle's skin. This material would not
oxidize. It also was light, weighing as little as 15 pounds per cubic
foot, or one-fourth the density of water.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This material would form the well-known
"tiles" of the Shuttle program, being attached to the skin in the
form of numerous small shapes somewhat resembling bricks. In 1969,
their immediate prospect lay in simplifying the design of hot
structures. These might now dispense with their shingles; engineers
instead would use titanium to craft an aircraft structure, with skin
[<A NAME="222"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">222</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] covering an internal framework, then provide thermal
protection by covering the skin with the tiles. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The design studies of 1969 raised another
tantalizing prospect: that these tiles might offer enough heat
resistance to build the basic structure of aluminum rather than
titanium. Titanium was hard to work with; few machine shops had the
necessary expertise. Moreover, its principal uses in aerospace had
occurred within classified programs such as the SR-71, which meant
that much of the pertinent shop-floor experience itself was
classified. This metal could withstand higher temperatures than
aluminum. Yet, if tiles could protect aluminum, the use of that metal
would open the shuttle to the entire aerospace industry. In
Silveira's words, building aluminum airplanes was something that "the
industry knew how to do. The industry had, on the floor,
standards-things like, 'What are the proper cutting speeds?' They
knew how to rivet or machine aluminum." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">44</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hot structures, built of titanium, would
continue to represent an important approach in shuttle design. As
early as 1969, however, Lockheed took the initiative in designing a
shuttle orbiter built of aluminum and protected with tiles. General
Dynamics added its own concept, featuring aluminum protected by
shingled hot structures that could keep internal temperatures below
200 &#176;F.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the end of 1969, the contractors' orbiter
concepts were as follows, with the boosters being similar:

variants of Faget's two-stage concept, which showed that shuttle
design had come a long way during that year. Twelve months earlier,
the candidate configurations included expendable boosters as well as
partially- and fully-reusable concepts. The range of alternatives
included the Titan III-M with an enlarged Dyna-Soar, the Star
Clipper, and the Triamese. These were as mutually dissimilar as a
fighter, a bomber, and a commercial airliner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">People still debated such issues as delta
wings vs. straight, aluminum vs. titanium, and hot structures vs.
tiles. By year's end, however, everyone agreed that the shuttle would
look much like Faget's. This meant that the most basic issues of
configuration had been settled, allowing engineers to advance to
deeper levels of detail. The studies of 1970 would pursue such
levels, and would lay important groundwork for the eventual evolution
of complete engineering designs, explicit in all particulars.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The work of 1969 had given the space station
more support than the Shuttle. The studies of that year initially had
allocated $5.8 million for the station and only $1.2 million for the
Shuttle; the additional funds granted for the latter at midyear,
totalling less than $0.7 million, did little to redress this
imbalance. In 1970, however, NASA would bring the shuttle to the
forefront. In this year, the centerpiece of effort would involve two
$8-million contracts for further work on the shuttle. There would be
no significant amount of new funding for the station. These internal
NASA decisions would point toward abandonment of the station, at
least for a number of years, and elevation of the Shuttle into the
sole focus for NASA's future. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Station Fades; Shuttle
Advances</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In preparation for the work of 1970, NASA and
its contractors established a new set of institutional arrangements.
Following a proposal of Dale Myers, the agency gave responsibility
for managing the upcoming study contracts to NASA-Marshall and to the
MSC. Each center would hold a complete contract, covering both the
booster and orbiter. Marshall, however, would provide technical
direction for the booster [<A NAME="224"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">224</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] portion of both
contracts, while MSC would give similar direction for the orbiter
portions. This continued the arrangements of Apollo, which had
assigned responsibility for the Saturn V to Marshall and for the
Apollo moonship to MSC. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">47</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the industry, competing companies made
their own arrangements. There would be only two principal new study
contracts, but there were many more than two firms eager for the
business, and several of them proceeded to form teams. This reflected
the Shuttle's two-stage design, for the complete shuttle was likely
to be too large a project for a single contractor to handle.
Accordingly, Lockheed teamed up with Boeing, with the two companies
proposing respectively to handle the orbiter and booster. North
American Rockwell joined with General Dynamics, while McDonnell
Douglas associated with Martin Marietta. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">48</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another and highly important set of decisions
extended the scope of Air Force-NASA cooperation. The two agencies
had collaborated on a joint study of shuttle requirements as part of
the work of the STG; this had led to the issuance of a three volume
report in June 1969, classified Secret. That collaboration, however,
had merely served the immediate needs of the STG and its supporting
studies. Now, in February 1970, Paine and Seamans agreed to set up a
permanent coordinating committee, with members to be drawn in equal
numbers from each agency. As in the 1969 joint study, there again
would be two co-chairmen: Dale Myers and Grant Hansen. Hansen had
co-chaired the earlier study, while Myers would replace Mueller, on
behalf of NASA. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">49</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On the matter of crossrange, at least for the
moment, they agreed to disagree. Neither agency would seek to impose
its will on the other. Rather, each main study contract would conduct
two design exercises in parallel: one for an orbiter with crossrange
of 200 nautical miles, the second with capability of 1,500 nautical
miles. The first was well within the reach of Faget's straight-wing
concepts; the second called for more than the Air Force would need.
Like a baseball player who swings two bats during warmup and then
finds that his single bat feels lighter, the exercise of designing
for 1500 nautical [<A NAME="225"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">225</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] miles would stretch
the minds of engineers and make it easier for them to achieve the
1100 nautical miles that represented the real requirement.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">From the outset, however, Paine and Seamans
could agree on an important point which Paine described as "a payload
volume of 15 feet diameter by 60 feet long." Previous studies had
considered payload bays not only of this size but of 22 feet diameter
by 30 feet long. The new requirement reflected the needs of both
agencies. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">50</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force needed length, for its
reconnaissance satellites amounted to orbiting telescopes, and these
had to be long to yield the sharpest images. Moreover, such
satellites were growing markedly in length. The Corona spacecraft of
the 1960s, each with an attached Agena upper stage, had started at 19
feet and quickly grew to 26. The CIA was now readying a new class of
satellites that would win the name of Big Bird. With dimensions of 40
by 10 feet, it represented a backup to MOL, whose length and width
had been virtually the same. The next generation of satellites,
called Kennan, would keep the 10-foot diameter but would grow in
length to 64 feet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Big Bird was in an advanced state of
development in 1970; the first of them flew to orbit atop a Titan
III-D in June 1971. Their photos gave a resolution of two feet.
Kennan was still in initial studies, for it would introduce
long-duration operations and the use of charge-coupled devices rather
than film. Though it would not fly until December 1976, its images
would show resolution as sharp as six inches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1970, the size of Kennan had not been
fixed; indeed, very little about this project had been fixed. It was
clear to Air Force planners, however, that they would face an
increasing need to launch long satellites. Accordingly, they declared
that they would need a length of 60 feet for the shuttle's payload
bay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While NASA did not need so much length, its
officials wanted a 15-foot diameter to accommodate modules for a
space station. This reflected a new approach to the design of such
stations. The studies of the 1960s, including those that Paine had
initiated in 1969, had envisioned a space station as a single unit
that would fly atop a Saturn I-B or Saturn V. As the prospects for
Saturns faded while those of the Shuttle seemed to advance, it
appeared prudent to envision a class of stations that could be
assembled in space as an [<A NAME="226"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">226</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] array of
cylindrical modules, one module per shuttle flight. A shuttle bay
with this diameter would accommodate modules 14 feet across,
intermediate between the 10 feet of MOL and the 22 feet of Skylab.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, a 15-by-60 foot bay would serve
the needs of both agencies by providing room for the space tug and
its payloads. Many spacecraft would fly to high orbit, including
geosynchronous orbit, and the payload bay had to address such
expectations as that future communications satellites would also grow
larger. Thus, when Dale Myers asked Grant Hansen to weigh the merits
of a reduction to 12 x 40 feet, Hansen replied:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The length of the payload bay is the
   more critical dimension affecting DOD mission needs. If the
   payload bay length is reduced to 40 feet, then 71 of the 149
   payloads forecasted for the 1981 to 1990 time period in Option C
   and 129 of the 232 payloads forecasted in Option B of the mission
   model will require launch vehicles of the Titan III
   family....</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 15 foot diameter by 60 foot length
   payload bay size previously stated as the DOD requirement is based
   upon payloads presently in the inventory, on the potential use of
   a reusable upper stage to accomplish our high energy missions, and
   on a capability to provide limited payload growth. This
   requirement is still considered valid.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In summary, should you elect to develop
   the shuttle with a 12 ft x 40 ft payload compartment, it will
   preclude our full use of the potential capability and operational
   flexibility offered by the shuttle.... Also, if a portion of the
   present expendable launch vehicle stable must be retained to
   satisfy some mission requirements, then the potential economic
   attractiveness and the utility of the shuttle to the DoD is
   severely diminished.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On February 20, NASA officials issued the
formal Request for Proposals (RFP) that would lead to awards of the
Shuttle study contracts of 1970. In addition to studies of the
complete two-stage vehicle, a separate RFP solicited proposals for
similarly detailed studies of a main engine. Competing companies had
30 days to respond; the submitted proposals would then go before a
Source Evaluation Board that would pick the winners. This board
included members from the Air Force. On May 12, it chose the teams
headed by [<A NAME="227"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">227</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] McDonnell Douglas
and by North American Rockwell and accepted their bids. These
companies now were to proceed with 11-month studies that would carry
their shuttle designs to new levels of detail, with each study
contract being funded at $8 million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A year earlier, those same companies had won
similar $2.9 million contracts for studies of the space station. This
reflected their strength, for they were the only firms to have
designed and built both piloted spacecraft and large hydrogen-fueled
rocket stages for Apollo. McDonnell had built the Mercury and Gemini
spacecraft; Douglas' credits included the S-IVB stage, MOL, and the
upcoming Skylab. North American's record included the Apollo
spacecraft and the S-II, the second stage of the Saturn V. Other
companies had gained strong achievements: General Dynamics's Atlas,
Lockheed's Agena stages used with Corona, Martin Marietta's Titan
family, Grumman's Apollo lunar module. In their experience, however,
McDonnell Douglas and North American Rockwell were in a class by
themselves. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">They had initiated their current space station
studies in September 1969. By the following July, these companies had
carried their designs to a good level of detail. Their stations would
take shape as a cylinder with diameter of 33 feet, suitable for
launch by Saturn V, surmounted by an enormous solar array. Jack
Heberlig, a space station manager at MSC, described the internal
layout as "basically four decks with a cellar and an attic." The
cellar and attic would house spacecraft equipment, including storage
tanks as well as noisy fans and blowers, with acoustic insulation to
keep their noise from disturbing the crew. The four decks would
provide room for living and working.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mockups, built by the contractors, showed how
crew members would live in comfort. Each person would have a
stateroom resembling a small college dorm room, with a bunk bed, desk
and chair, television and communications equipment, and plenty of
storage space in drawers and a closet. Two communal lavatories would
each provide a shower stall, urinal, and a zero-gravity toilet called
a "dry john." The commander's stateroom would feature a personal
lavatory, a small conference table, and a computer terminal-which was
rare in 1970.</FONT></P>

area, a similar table would provide room for hobbies and games, with
television and movies also being available. A medical room with a
treatment table would serve as a dispensary and first-aid station,
while also supporting studies of crew members' general health.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though a Saturn V was to launch this station,
its logistics were to depend on use of the Shuttle. Heberlig
projected "a minimum of 91 Shuttle flights over
[<A NAME="229"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">229</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] a 10-year period." In July 1970, with the
Shuttle/station having survived by the narrowest of margins in both
the Senate and House, it was clear that to proceed with simultaneous
development of both projects would court disaster.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">54</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Dale Myers responded by deciding to move ahead
with the Shuttle first. This brought a major NASA decision that
redirected the ongoing space station studies. While work on
33-foot-diameter versions would continue, the agency now would
emphasize investigation of modular versions, which the Shuttle could
build in orbit as well as service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This decision took shape as part of the
broader cutbacks that Paine announced in September 1970. Those
cutbacks canceled two Apollo missions, freeing their Saturn V rockets
for other duty, and Paine noted hopefully that they might find use
"in the Skylab, Space Station or other programs where manned
operations or a heavy boost capability is required."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">55</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in 1969, a year and a half previously,
it had appeared obvious that Paine's station, with its crew of 12,
would fly atop a Saturn V. The space station studies of that decade
had all assumed use of Saturn-class launch vehicles, with the Shuttle
merely as a handmaiden, a logistics vehicle that was poorly defined.
By mid-1970, however, the Shuttle and station had reversed positions.
The Shuttle now was ready to stand on its own, justified in large
part by the work it could do in supporting the Air Force's
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">automated</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> spacecraft. With the Saturn V now representing the
rarest and most valuable of commodities, NASA could expect to use it
only after the most searching examination of alternatives. These
alternatives would particularly include the construction of modular
space stations, which could avoid use of Saturn-class boosters
entirely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now it was the station that retreated to the
realm of initial studies. There was no clear understanding, at least
in 1970, of how specifically one might proceed with such modular
stations, for the work to date had emphasized the design of such
stations as large single units. North American Rockwell and McDonnell
Douglas carried through an appropriate round of studies during 1971,
and issued their reports. Then, with budget cuts continuing to
squeeze future goals, NASA largely dropped its plans for such
stations pending.... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After 1970, with the space station off in the
wilderness, its supporters could at least take heart that the
Shuttle's capacious payload bay had been sized to accommodate its
modules. The size of that bay also served a more immediate purpose,
for it helped to nail down Air Force support. During the latter
months of 1970, events showed that by working to win this support,
and by deferring the space station to a much later time, NASA was
well on the way to overcoming its opposition in Congress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The NASA appropriation for FY 1971 had been
part of an omnibus spending bill that had included funds for the
Department of Housing and Urban [<A NAME="231"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">231</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Development. In
debate during July, the Senate had added $400 million for the
programs that Paine described as "sewers." This led Nixon to veto the
entire bill, forcing NASA and the other affected agencies to get by
for a time through the temporary funding provided by a continuing
resolution in Congress. The Senate again took up the appropriations
measure on December 7, and once more Senator Mondale introduced his
amendment that sought to delete funding for the
Shuttle/station.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This time it went down to defeat by a
comfortable margin, 26 to 50. Several senators switched their votes
to support NASA, with one of them being John Pastore, chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. Following the vote, he stated, "This
matter came before the Senate twice; the matter has been decided. It
has been decided by the House and it has been decided by the Senate."
Mondale continued to introduce similar amendments on subsequent
occasions, but found his quest becoming increasingly lonely as they
met defeat by even larger margins: 22 to 64 in 1971, 21 to 61 in
1972. But with the Senate vote of December 1970, it was already clear
that opposition had collapsed. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">57</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Also during 1970, the joint NASA-Air Force
Space Transportation System Committee emerged as a forum where
representatives of the two agencies could hammer out solutions in
areas of disagreement. The February 1970 concordat between Paine and
Seamans, that established this committee, also stated that shuttle
development "will be managed by NASA" and "will be generally
unclassified." At meetings of this committee, however, Air Force
officials proved quite frank in presenting classified material to
support that service's point of view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At a committee meeting on June 29, the Air
Force gave a briefing on the size and weight requirements of DoD
payloads. This began by disclosing the size and weight of current
payloads, and went on to project the specifications of future
payloads, eight to ten years ahead. The presentation also reviewed
the history of Air Force launch vehicle payload capabilities and the
length of payload fairings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This briefing supported the Air Force demand
for a 60-by-15 foot cargo bay. The length would accommodate both
current and future payloads; the [<A NAME="232"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">232</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] diameter would
provide room for a space tug. It would also alleviate design
complications associated with the restrictions of current launch
vehicles such as the Titan III-D, which limited spacecraft to
diameters of 10 feet. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">58</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA willingly accepted this requirement,
incorporating it explicitly within the Study Control Document that
would guide the new round of space shuttle studies. However, this
document did not specify a payload weight. At that same meeting on
June 29, the Air Force declared that it wanted the Shuttle to carry
40,000 pounds to low polar orbit. This again would provide room for
growth; Big Bird, a year away from its first launch, weighed close to
30,000 pounds, and future spacecraft would certainly be
heavier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA officials gave their response at another
committee meeting, on October 2. They noted that the baseline
mission, described in the Study Control Document, had continued to
involve logistics resupply of a space station or space base, in an
orbit with an inclination of 55 degrees. The Shuttle was to carry
25,000 pounds to this orbit. Following reentry, however, it would not
glide to its home base, but would fly with power from turbojet
engines. New studies now showed that an operational shuttle could
indeed glide safely to this base, dispensing with those jet engines.
That would save weight; the Air Force's requirement of 40,000 pounds
then would indeed be achievable. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">59</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By now it was clear that the Air Force was
very much in the pilot's seat when it came to steering the Shuttle
program. Max Faget learned this late in 1970, when he wrote a memo to
his deputy director at MSC: "The USAF appears not to be nearly as
firm on the 15 ft. diameter requirements as they are in length. NASA
has no need for 15 ft. diameter either. It is suggested that you
attempt to have the payload diameter reduced to 12 ft."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faget was a power within NASA. He was Director
of Engineering and Development at the MSC and reported directly to
the head of that center, Robert Gilruth. It took the Air Force only
three days to put him in his place, with a reply that read: "The USAF
fully supports and stands firm on the present Level I requirement for
a payload diameter of 15 feet and a length of 60 feet." This reply
came from one Patrick Crotty-whose rank was no higher than major.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">60</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="233"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">233</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Late in December,
NASA formally upgraded the Shuttle's status. It had been managed by
the Space Shuttle Task Group, headed by Leroy Day. The space station
had resided within a similar task group. Now the Shuttle received a
separate program office, headed by Charles Donlan, Deputy Associate
Administrator for Manned Space Flight. Donlan reported directly to
Dale Myers, an Associate Administrator, and also kept Day as his own
deputy. On NASA's organization chart, this raised the Shuttle to the
status of such programs as Mercury, Gemini, and Skylab.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A month later, on January 19 and 20, 1971,
NASA hosted a meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia, that included
representatives from shuttle study contractors and from the Air
Force. This meeting had the purpose of defining shuttle requirements
that would guide the work of these contractors. NASA used the
occasion to give the Air Force everything it wanted. In particular,
the Shuttle would have a delta wing, with crossrange of 1100 n.mi.
Its payload capacity, 40,000 pounds into polar orbit, would
correspond to 65,000 pounds in a due-east launch from Cape Canaveral.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">61</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One sometimes hears that when two parties are
in a relationship, the one that wants it more is the weaker. NASA
certainly had been pursuing support for the Shuttle with unmaidenly
eagerness, and the Williamsburg rules were the result. The agency now
was promising to build a bigger and heavier shuttle than it had
wanted for its own uses, with considerably more thermal protection.
It also was prepared to treat the Shuttle as a national asset-which
meant the Air Force would not pay for its development or production
and yet would receive the equivalent of exclusive use of one or more
of these vehicles, entirely gratis. That service would not receive
the Shuttle on a silver platter, but would pay for construction of
its own launch facilities at Vandenberg AFB. With the Air Force
having by far the larger budget as well as greater political clout,
the Williamsburg agreement resembled a treaty between a superpower
and a banana republic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Max Faget, for one, was not about to bow to
the Air Force's superior wisdom. He was responsible for providing
technical direction on the orbiter portions of the shuttle study
contracts. His designers duly proceeded to turn out representative
designs of delta-wing configurations that could guide the work of the
contractors. His heart, however, remained with the straight wing.
[<A NAME="234"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">234</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] He continued to come forward with new design variants
until well into 1971, when as Dale Myers recalls, "I just denied MSC
further activities on the straight-wing version."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">62</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Having carried through its elaborate courtship
(some people would prefer a different word) of the Air Force, NASA
was now about to reap its reward. This came in March 1971, when Air
Force Secretary Seamans presented testimony before the Senate space
committee:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now let me address the Air Force views
   regarding development of the Space Transportation System. The DOD
   supports its development if the results of current NASA Phase B
   studies and our own complementary studies show that such a system
   is feasible and can offer the desired performance and cost
   advantages over current systems. Preliminary indications from
   these studies are that such a system can be developed. If the
   final study results confirm this, and we think they will, the Air
   Force will provide a strong recommendation that Shuttle
   development be authorized. When the operational system is
   achieved, we would expect to use it to orbit essentially all DOD
   payloads, "phasing out" our expendable booster inventory with the
   possible exception of very small boosters such as the SCOUT.

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The DOD investment over the next two to

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Seamans was not ready to give full
consent, or to promise to give up the Air Force's cherished Titan III
family, he certainly was saying "maybe," and was saying it
emphatically.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Shuttle program was advancing in another
respect. With studies of its main engine having been under way for
some time, NASA was about to award a contract for its actual
development. With this engine as a long-lead item, this would be the
first major component of the Shuttle to reach this level of
commitment, advancing beyond the level of studies and design
exercises to become a true hardware project.</FONT></P>

FACE="Geneva">The Space Shuttle Main Engine</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The legacies of the 1960s include the use of
hydrogen as a rocket fuel, which powered two important engines of the
period. The RL-10, developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney, had a rated
thrust of 15,000 pounds. Two of them were in the Centaur upper stage.
The J-2 of Rocketdyne was an important component of Apollo, with five
of these engines in the S-II stage of the Saturn V and a single J-2
in the S-IVB. Its thrust was 230,000 pounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The RL-10 and J-2 certainly did not represent
the last word in rocketry. As early as 1967, well before the Shuttle
began to take shape, the Air Force initiated an advanced propulsion
program that led to new work at both Rocketdyne and Pratt &amp;
Whitney. These firms selected different approaches toward improving
the hydrogen-fueled rocket engine, with the intent of building test
hardware.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Rocketdyne, the point of departure involved
an inescapable shortcoming of conventional rocket nozzles, which had
the shape of a bell. Within these nozzles, during and after liftoff,
atmospheric pressure retarded the free expansion and outward flow of
an engine's exhaust. This reduced both its thrust and exhaust
velocity-and did so just when the launch vehicle was heavy with fuel
and was burning propellant at the most rapid rate, thereby needing
all the thrust and performance it could get.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The cure appeared to lie in a new type of
engine, the aerospike. It required a ring-shaped combustion chamber
surrounding a central body that resembled an upside-down volcano,
with inward-sloping flanks and a central vent. Turbine exhaust flowed
through the vent; the main engine exhaust expanded against the
flanks, with no wall or barrier separating this exhaust from the
atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure thus worked freely to shape the
exhaust plume as it exited the engine. The aerospike concept offered
a compact engine installation that could perform nearly as well at
sea level as in a vacuum. However, this performance was somewhat less
than could be achieved with a conventional bell nozzle.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">65</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Accordingly, Pratt &amp; Whitney accepted the
disadvantages of the bell and sought to achieve the highest possible
performance by raising the engine's internal pressure. The J-2 had
operated at 763 pounds per square inch. Pratt.... </FONT></P>

aerospikes. Thus, when concepts of the Shuttle began to jell, during
1969, these programs offered two paths toward development of a

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other questions raised searching issues in a
host of technical areas: turbine design for high temperatures,
high-speed turbopumps, seals and pump bearings, and ground-test
facilities, onboard engine checkout using computers. Von Braun also
expressed concern that engine materials would become brittle when
exposed to hot hydrogen at high pressures. In addition to this, he
sought to uncover shortcomings in the aerospike, which faced possible
problems of delayed ignition, combustion instability, sources of hot
gas to drive the turbines, and the credibility of estimates for
component weights and efficiencies. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">67</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The aerospike held on through the summer, with
shuttle managers not only continuing to consider it on an equal basis
with the high-pressure bell, but even looking at shuttle designs
offering interchangeability between both types of engine. NASA and
its contractors, however, had no real experience with the aerospike,
though they had plenty with the bell; indeed, all their rocket
engines built and flown to date had been of the bell type. In
October, a meeting of shuttle managers brought a decision to use the
bell type only. This decision won unanimous support from key
technical people at both NASA-Marshall and the Manned Spacecraft
Center. With this, the aerospike was out in the cold.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">68</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This was bad news for Rocketdyne, which had
conducted a limited amount of high-pressure work but nevertheless had
spent several years placing its money on the wrong horse. It was
correspondingly good news at Pratt &amp; Whitney, which had a solid
head start. That firm had already built and tested a high-pressure
thrust chamber, suitable for the XLR-129, though that chamber had
lacked its own turbopumps. High-performance turbopumps, however, were
becoming a specialty of the house within this company, which was also
pursuing a NASA project. It was building versions suitable for a
high-pressure engine of 350,000 pounds of thrust.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">69</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even so, NASA was not about to accept the
XLR-129, for that engine promised 250,000 pounds of thrust and NASA
wanted 415,000, to reduce the [<A NAME="239"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">239</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] number and weight
of the engines in the Shuttle's booster. In turn, those 415,000
pounds were to come from an entirely new rocket motor, the Space
Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Still, it was highly likely that this
SSME would take shape as an enlarged XLR-129.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In February 1970, NASA issued a Request for
Proposal that would lead to the award of three contracts, each funded
at $6 million, for detailed engineering studies of the SSME. These
contracts went to Rocketdyne, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Aerojet
General. Aerojet had its own strong base of experience; it had built
the hydrogen-fueled NERVA test engines in collaboration with
Westinghouse, and had also built main and upper-stage engines for the
Titan family. Though the Air Force now turned the XLR-129 effort over
to NASA, Air Force engineers remained active within this program,
transferring XLR-129 technology to Rocketdyne and Aerojet and making
sure that its lessons were understood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During 1970, Pratt &amp; Whitney showed anew
that it had the team to beat. In its work on the NASA 350,000-pound
engine, it built a hydrogen turbopump that produced over 100
horsepower per pound of weight of its turbomachinery. In World War
II, nearly 30 years earlier, builders of aircraft piston engines had
counted it as a milestone to achieve a single horsepower per pound;
the new turbopump thus was 100 times better. It also had five times
the power density of Rocketdyne's J-2, which offered only 20
horsepower per pound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In August, Pratt &amp; Whitney demonstrated a
hydrogen turbopump for the XLR-129. This test drove its turbine with
a flow of hot gas from a preburner, a high-pressure auxiliary
combustion chamber. This work had particular significance because it
went forward unusually quickly. In developing turbopumps for the
350,000-pound engine, this company had taken two years to raise the
working pressure of the hydrogen pump to 6000 psi. Its engineers
attained 6700 psi with the new XLR-129 pump in no more than six
months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The company also used XLR-129 hardware as a
testbed for the SSME. The latter was to have a combustion chamber
pressure of 3000 psi. While the XLR-129 had a design pressure of 2740
psi, tests of its thrust chamber repeatedly demonstrated successful
operation at and above the level of the SSME. Pratt &amp; Whitney
went on to conduct some 200 test firings at these elevated pressures.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">70</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="240"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">240</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At Rocketdyne, the
head of the SSME effort was Paul Castenholz, a corporate
vice-president who had previously been project manager on the J-2.
While he knew he would need more than paper studies to win against
Pratt &amp; Whitney, he also saw an opportunity to go that company
one better. The complete SSME would include preburners driving
turbopumps, a main combustion chamber fed by an injector, and a
nozzle. To build SSME-class turbopumps was out of the question; the
work would take too long. The rest of the engine was another
matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Castenholz saw that he could build a complete
thrust chamber with everything but the turbopumps. He could craft it
using SSME materials and manufacturing processes. Lacking pumps, he
would have to feed its propellants using tanks under high pressure.
He then could run tests that would demonstrate essential features of
a successful SSME: a thrust of 415,000 pounds, stable combustion, a
chamber pressure of 3000 psi, and cooling of the engine. He could do
these things at full scale. Pratt &amp; Whitney had already done most
of them repeatedly, but only in an XLR-129 thrust chamber, of 250,000
pounds of thrust. By leaping ahead into the realm of the SSME,
Castenholz hoped to put his firm back in the race.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The recent NASA engine study contract provided
no funds for this work. He approached the president of Rocketdyne,
William Brennan, and asked for up to $3 million in company money.
Brennan sent him on to meet with Robert Anderson, president of the
parent company of Rockwell International, who approved this
expenditure. Castenholz's engineers then set to work, with an
important concern being the prevention of combustion instability
within the engine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Good injector design would suppress this
instability. Castenholz started with an injector based on that of the
J-2, which had shown its stability during this engine's repeated
operational use. He then added technical features that experience had
shown would promote even more stability. In the words of a close
associate, Robert Biggs, "We put two big preventers on an injector
that was basically stable to begin with." While this was like wearing
both belt and suspenders, it offered a reasonable guarantee that the
thrust chamber would work properly on its first try.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The engine testing proceeded at the Nevada
Field Laboratory, a rocket facility some 20 miles northeast of Reno,
in the Virginia Mountains. The initial work, late in 1970, involved
an uncooled thrust chamber that worked as a.... </FONT></P>

metal rather than using flows of propellant to carry the heat away.
While the thickness of the metal made the engine strong and unlikely
to explode, it still could run only very briefly before it would burn
a hole in its side and blow up. The first tests dealt only with
starting the engine, with ignition trials that ran to durations less
than five seconds and pressures that stayed well below rated
levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early in 1971, the cooled thrust chamber was
ready, aiming at NASA's requirements: 415,000 pounds of thrust,
14,670 ft/sec in exhaust velocity, 3000 psi in pressure. The last
test achieved full thrust for only 0.45 seconds. It nevertheless
bettered these numbers substantially, delivering 505,700 pounds,
14,990 ft/sec, and 3172 psi. This was twice the rated thrust of the
XLR-129, and 60 ft/sec greater in its exhaust velocity. Though small,
this improvement was significant. It promised a shuttle payload
nearly 2000 pounds heavier than Pratt &amp; Whitney's engine might
carry to orbit, along with a saving in the program cost of close to
$50 million. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">71</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="242"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">242</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] No engine, not even
the XLR-129, had yet operated as a complete unit, with turbopumps
together with its thrust chamber. Pratt &amp; Whitney soon
accumulated a total of 2877 seconds of test operation of its XLR-129
chamber, rated at 250,000 pounds, along with its full-pressure tests
of advanced turbopumps for both this engine and the 350,000-pound
model. Rocketdyne, in turn, had demonstrated successful starting and
stable operation within its SSME thrust chamber, though only briefly.
Then, in late January, NASA officials changed the requirements,
raising the planned thrust of the SSME from 415,000 to 550,000
pounds. This reflected the growing weight of the Space Shuttle as a
launch vehicle, which now was to carry up to 65,000 pounds in
payload. Though Rocketdyne had not known that this thrust was to
increase, its high-thrust engine test, delivering 505,700 pounds in a
chamber built for 415,000, meant that it remained close even to this
new requirement. By contrast, the best of Pratt &amp; Whitney's
achievements, at 350,000 pounds, lagged well behind.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">72</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"The highest risk I've ever taken, in terms of
a rocket engine, was to build this full-scale thrust chamber for a
proposal," Castenholz recalls. "We worked around the clock. We slept
at Rocketdyne in the hospital, every night for a month." Though this
did not help his marriage (he and his wife Marilyn later divorced),
it did provide what he would need to take to NASA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">High-speed cameras had filmed the tests in
Nevada. Those films now were ready to show to officials at
NASA-Marshall, who were managing work on the SSME. Castenholz
arranged to take along the actual thrust chamber: "We thought it was
necessary that everyone who would be on the evaluation program should
see that we'd actually done it." He wanted them to see his chamber
and touch it, not just read about it: "If you can touch something,
you feel more comfortable."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Castenholz made a presentation to officials
that included Eberhard Rees, the center director. He had succeeded
Von Braun, who had taken a position at NASA Headquarters in
Washington. Robert Biggs, Castenholz's associate, described this as
"the best briefing I've ever seen." It included multiple slide
projectors and movies with sound, and not all the scenes were of
rockets. When Castenholz said that they had done the test in winter,
his slides showed the desert covered with snow. Following the
briefing, Rees turned to a colleague and said, "Now I really believe
it can be done."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="243"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">243</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] It was March 1971;
NASA now was issuing the Request for Proposal that would lead to the
award of a contract for actual development of an operational SSME.
Rocketdyne's proposal included an executive summary, seven volumes on
technical issues, five volumes on management, and 81 more of
supporting data. "Thousands of pages, and beautifully done,"
Castenholz recalls. "A thick document devoted to every detail.
Materials. What the materials included. How it was
manufactured-pictures of the manufacturing. The tools we used. The
test program-how many tests. Each test. Why. Where."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Copies of the proposal went off to
NASA-Marshall on April 21, with each complete copy filling a
bookcase. The denouement came on July 13. Castenholz recalls that it
was rather casual: "I got a call one day. Bill Brennan called me in
and said, 'We won.' Bob Anderson came the next day." Then Rocketdyne
held a party, inviting all participants. Castenholz recalls feeling
"tremendous, joyous that we'd accomplished it. The idea that we'd won
was almost mystical." He thought of things that could have gone
wrong, but concluded, "I was fortunate to lead a good team. What won?
Running that chamber won, and writing a super proposal."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">73</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was no joy in West Palm Beach, Florida,
the home of Pratt &amp; Whitney. That firm had taken out
advertisements in major aerospace magazines, stating, "We can't wait
to start working on the SSME. So we haven't." It had solicited help
from the local congressman, Paul Rogers, who had led his state's
congressional delegation-including both senators-in writing a letter
to Nixon on behalf of this company and its proposal. (Nixon had
failed to intervene, and it would not have escaped his attention that
California had more electoral votes than Florida.) There was still a
possibility, however, that Richard Mulready, Castenholz's
counterpart, might yet win the chance to build the SSME. Rocketdyne's
margin of victory had been narrow indeed: a score of 711 to 705 in
the score of the source evaluation board. It might not take much to
tip the balance in the other direction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Accordingly, the president of Pratt &amp;
Whitney, Bruce Torell, lodged a formal protest with the General
Accounting Office, with his legal representatives filing a 100-page
brief that listed six areas of complaint. The attorneys
[<A NAME="244"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">244</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] asserted that Rocketdyne's proposal held technical
deficiencies that violated NASA specifications. NASA also had
allegedly failed to conduct meaningful negotiations, had treated the
Pratt &amp; Whitney proposal in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner,
and had accepted procedures that "maximize the risk of cost
overruns." Rocketdyne had supposedly obtained an unfair advantage by
diverting funds from the Saturn program to support its SSME effort. A
sixth cause of complaint was perhaps the most heartfelt: "Selection
of Rocketdyne wastes 11 years of knowledge, test-proven design, and
government investment in prior Pratt &amp; Whitney programs." The
company had been working on high-performance hydrogen-fueled engines
since 1960. Yet if the contract award could not be overturned through
this appeal, the firm would have nothing but its RL-10 engine for the
Centaur, developed a decade prior to 1971.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This appeal put the contract award on hold.
The Comptroller General, Elmer Staats, would not negotiate directly
with the competing companies; rather, he would deal with NASA, which
had reviewed the contracts and had held the legal responsibility to
conduct the competition fairly. NASA's case now harmonized with
Rocketdyne's: that the agency had followed proper procedures and had
conducted a valid assessment of the proposals. Rocketdyne retained
its own legal counsel; Castenholz recalls that "we had an attorney in
New York who handled our case." Until Staats made his decision,
however, the SSME was moribund. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">74</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During that summer of 1971, it became clear
that the Shuttle program as well was in serious trouble. Not only had
it failed to win presidential authorization to proceed; it also was
receiving increasingly severe treatment at the hands of critics.
While NASA's pact with the Air Force had stilled most of the doubters
in Congress, these critics would not be mollified so easily. They
were in the Bureau of the Budget.</FONT></P>
