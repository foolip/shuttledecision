<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="151"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">151</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] On an afternoon in
July 1969, while the Apollo 11 mission stood poised for a flight to
the moon, Tom Paine found himself confronted by a group of civil
rights demonstrators. Their leader was Reverend Ralph Abernathy,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Abernathy
had succeeded Martin Luther King in that post, following the death of
King a year earlier. Abernathy now came to Cape Canaveral on the eve
of NASA's triumph.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A light mist of rain fell intermittently, as
thunder rumbled in the distance. Paine stood coatless under a cloudy
sky, accompanied only by NASA's press officer, as Abernathy
approached with his party, marching slowly and singing "We Shall
Overcome." Several mules were in the lead, as symbols of rural
poverty. Abernathy then gave a short speech. He deplored the
condition of the nation's poor, declaring that one-fifth of the
nation lacked adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. In
the face of such suffering, he asserted that space flight represented
an inhuman priority. He urged that its funds be spent to feed the
hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick, and house the
homeless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine replied that "if we could solve the
problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the
moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button." He added that
NASA's technical advances were "child's play" compared to "the
tremendously difficult human problems" that concerned the SCLC. He
offered the hope that NASA indeed might contribute to addressing
these problems, and then asked Abernathy, a minister, to pray for the
safety of the astronauts. Abernathy answered with emotion that he
[<A NAME="152"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">152</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] would certainly do this, and they ended this
impromptu meeting by shaking hands all around. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Their brief conversation brought no lasting
consequence. Yet it was heavy with history, for Paine and Abernathy
stood as representatives of two deep themes that had marked the
nation's experience before America even existed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine was the technologist, heir to a record
of splendid accomplishment. His forebears had built ships,
constructed transcontinental railroads, dug the Panama Canal,
captured water to allow cities to grow in the arid West, flung power
and telephone lines from coast to coast. They had built highways and
factories, had put the nation on wheels, had mastered the art of
flight. At that very moment, others were winning achievement in the
realm of computers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was, however, another and far more
somber side to America's history, for the nation had been conceived
in the original sin of slavery. Abraham Lincoln had proposed that
"every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword"; yet the stain ran so deep that not even the
Civil War could expunge it. Like Lincoln, Martin Luther King had
grappled with this sin, had sought the moral authority to sway a
deeply divided people; and like Lincoln, he had paid with his life,
with his goal only partly won.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Sixties</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"The legacy of Apollo has spoiled the people
at NASA," Wernher von Braun remarked in the wake of the moon landing.
"They believe that we are entitled to this kind of a thing forever,
which I gravely doubt. I believe that there may be too many people in
NASA who at the moment are waiting for a miracle, just waiting for
another man on a white horse to come and offer us another planet,
like President Kennedy." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1969, NASA still lived in the shadow of
Kennedy, both in its immediate concern with Apollo and in its
institutional hopes. Apollo had taken form as an initiative in
foreign policy. It could hardly have been otherwise; Kennedy was very
much a cold warrior, who had devoted his inaugural address entirely
to foreign affairs. There was a reason for this overriding concern:
[<A NAME="153"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">153</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] Kennedy, like his party, carried a heavy burden. The
party governed under its own shadow, for they had held both Congress
and the White House when China fell to communism in 1949.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is difficult to overstate the dismay with
which America faced the communist threat of the postwar years. It was
almost as if to say that our victory in the war was meaningless, that
we had defeated Japan and Germany only to face the far greater power
of Stalin and Chairman Mao. Less than a year after Mao proclaimed the
People's Republic of China, the U.S. was at war in Korea, a war that
President Truman would find himself neither able to win nor to end.
In turn, this war drove him from office. At home, fear of communism
encouraged the excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy and his allies,
who recklessly smeared the reputations of good and decent people
because of their political beliefs and activities, real or
alleged.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was the proud boast of Eisenhower's
Republicans that while Truman had lost not only China but Eastern
Europe, they had held the line. They had ended the Korean War, and
had preserved peace amid subsequent dangers in a perilous world.
Kennedy's main challenge was to continue to hold this line, to deny
Moscow and Beijing any further victories. Under the shadow of China,
however, he would not proceed with the calm confidence that had
marked Eisenhower and his policies. Living in that shadow, Kennedy's
Democrats would find themselves driven to become more anti-communist
than the Republicans. In conducting foreign policy, they worked amid
gnawing concern that they might prove to be weak, and would
compensate by becoming overly bold. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The most important consequence was the war in
Vietnam. When the French faced defeat in their struggle against Ho
Chi Minh in 1954, Ike had had his chance to intervene massively in
that country. Declining to do this, he had left the French to their
fate. But Vietnam was adjacent to China, in the one area of the world
where further communist advance was both most likely and most
unacceptable. Kennedy and his advisors accepted the domino theory,
which viewed South Vietnam as a linchpin: if it fell, the whole of
Southeast Asia would soon go as well. In 1961, General Lyman
Lemnitzer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that if
Saigon were to fall, "we would lose
[<A NAME="154"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">154</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] Asia all the way to Singapore." Kennedy, accepting
this view, made it a basis for policy. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Waging total cold war, Kennedy believed that
it was essential to deny Moscow propaganda victories as well as
military ones. A prime topic for propaganda was spaceflight, and in
no way would Kennedy concede that the Soviets might concentrate
resources into this area while failing their citizens in a host of
ways that were far more important. The issue was one of national
prestige, what in earlier times had been known as national honor: if
the world viewed space as important and saw that the Soviets were
ahead, then America would have to meet this challenge and take the
lead. Time and again, during the campaign of 1960, Kennedy spoke of
other nations and emphasized that leadership in space was essential
if America was not to forfeit their support:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The people of the world respect
   achievement. For most of the twentieth century they admired
   American science and American education, which was second to none.
   But now they are not at all certain about which way the future
   lies. The first vehicle in outer space was called Sputnik, not
   Vanguard. The first country to place its national emblem on the
   moon was the Soviet Union, not the United States.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">If the Soviet Union was first in outer
   space, that is the most serious defeat the United States has
   suffered in many, many years. Because we failed to recognize the
   impact that being first in outer space would have, the impression
   began to move around the world that the Soviet Union was on the
   march, that it had definite goals, that it knew how to accomplish
   them, that it was moving and we were standing still. That is what
   we have to overcome, that psychological feeling in the world that
   the United States has reached maturity, that maybe our high noon
   has passed and that now we are going into the long, slow
   afternoon</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ike had refused to be drawn into war in
Vietnam, leaving that commitment to Kennedy. At a cabinet meeting in
December 1960, Ike had also declined a commitment to the moon,
turning down a specific plan that closely resembled the eventual
Apollo.</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">
When Kennedy accepted that challenge, only
[<A NAME="155"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">155</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] five months later, the moon held a threefold
significance. It represented a simple and dramatic goal that everyone
could understand. It appeared reachable during that decade, and would
not impose a prolonged effort that might lose public interest. In
addition to this, the moon was demanding enough to call for an
entirely new array of launch vehicles and spacecraft, requiring far
more power than the Soviet rockets of the day could provide. The
Soviet lead in rocketry would not help them; like the Americans, they
would have to start afresh. Kennedy believed, correctly, that in the
resulting competition the U.S. would prove more capable in coming up
with the enormous sums of money that would be necessary to reach the
moon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the decade of the 1960s progressed, the
Cold War lost its sense of imminent threat. In 1961, Nikita
Khrushchev had provoked a crisis in Germany, and had built the Berlin
Wall. By 1968, however, the Democrats could say that they too had
held the line. By then nearly 20 years had elapsed since the fall of
China had given communism its last major territorial advance. The
Soviets had been stymied in Europe; America and its NATO allies had
protected West Berlin, even though that city was entirely surrounded
by communist territory. Though Fidel Castro ruled Cuba, he had failed
to spread his revolution elsewhere in the Caribbean or in Latin
America. In addition to this, communism had received a severe setback
in Southeast Asia in 1965, for General Suharto of Indonesia broke an
attempted communist takeover and went on to crush his country's
communist party. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1968, the nation was at war in Vietnam.
During February, amid the new year celebrations known as Tet, that
country's communist forces launched a massive and widespread series
of attacks. Battles raged in Saigon, where they penetrated the
grounds of the American embassy. They captured the city of Hue, an
ancient capital, and held it for several weeks. They laid siege to a
Marine base, Khe Sanh, pounding it with mortars and artillery. Dozens
of cities came under assault.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As a military engagement, this Tet Offensive
failed. Powerful counterattacks routed the communists, retaking Hue,
while the Marines held Khe Sanh. As a political exercise, however,
the offensive succeeded brilliantly. It drove home the fact that
North Vietnam was in the war to stay and would not be defeated by any
means short of additional massive escalation. In 1961,
[<A NAME="156"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">156</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] Kennedy had declared that America would "pay any
price, bear any burden" to prevail. By 1968, it was clear that the
nation would do nothing of the sort, at least not in Vietnam. In the
wake of that offensive, the question facing America was not how to
win, but how to withdraw. In turn, this reflected the waning of
foreign affairs as a paramount concern, for withdrawal clearly meant
that the nation would leave the battlefield on terms short of
victory. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While foreign affairs lost their
life-and-death character, the public turned to domestic concerns with
considerable passion. Now these issues that had languished since the
late 1930s, amid wars and military preparations, would have their
day. Foremost among them was race.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">We remember the 1960s for the civil rights
revolution. Its roots, however, went back an additional decade, and
embraced all three branches of the federal government. In 1954, the
Supreme Court showed that it would rule unanimously in upholding the
rights of black America, as Chief Justice Earl Warren led his
associate justices in handing down the landmark ruling,
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Brown v. Board of
Education</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, that struck down the
segregation of schools. Three years later, President Eisenhower
showed that he would enforce a desegregation order using federal
troops, as he sent elements of the 101st Airborne Division to quell a
dangerous mob in Little Rock, Arkansas. Also in 1957, Senate Majority
Leader Lyndon Johnson rallied two-thirds of his fellow senators to
break a filibuster and enact a civil rights bill. Though the bill was
weak, its significance was great; it was the first such measure
enacted since Reconstruction. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the lives of most black and white people,
however, nothing had changed. Though the Supreme Court ruling
represented binding precedent as case law, it lacked the force of a
federal statute. Federal civil rights law remained so weak that the
Justice Department lacked the legal standing to initiate lawsuits
aimed at achieving desegregation. The civil rights movement had an
episodic character; when Ike sent troops to Little Rock, for
instance, that city's crisis ended as quickly as if the Seventh
Cavalry had come riding to the rescue in a John Wayne movie.
Similarly, when Kennedy sent a federal force against armed white
rioters at the University of Mississippi in 1962, this news story
blazed up and died in a matter of days. Such events made it easy
[<A NAME="157"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">157</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] to believe that all was well, that federal marshals
would preserve order, and that America could continue without
fundamental change.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then in April 1963, Martin Luther King took
his movement to Birmingham, Alabama, which he described as "the
largest segregated city in the United States." Opposing him was the
city's powerful police commissioner, Eugene "Bull" Connor, an ardent
racist. King launched a succession of protest marches and
demonstrations that grew in size as the month progressed; Connor
struck back by arresting and jailing the demonstrators. King himself
became a prisoner; still the protests continued to grow. By early
May, Connor had literally run out of jail cells, and when the
demonstrations continued, he lashed at them with police dogs and with
fire hoses forceful enough to peel bark from a tree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Television networks that had been covering
Birmingham as an ongoing news story, now showed their power. When
viewers saw nonviolent protesters under attack by vicious dogs and
equally vicious police, the nation shuddered in dismay. This marked a
breakthrough in the cause of civil rights, for that movement now held
America's full attention, and would not let it go. A month later,
Kennedy himself addressed the nation, calling for a sweeping law that
would protect the rights of black citizens. Kennedy took this stand
before the election of 1964 and not after, for he expected to win a
second term. In turn, his reelection was to vindicate his leadership
on this most controversial of issues. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian Bruce Catton writes that during
the Civil War, newly-freed blacks "were men coming up out of Egypt,
trailing the shreds of a long night from their shoulders." For many
of their descendants, the passage of a century had brought little
change. Thus in 1964, a black woman named Fannie Lou Hamer told of
her attempt to register to vote as a resident of Mississippi:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet if federal legislation could extirpate
such evils, the nation now would certainly make the attempt. The
Civil Rights Act, which became law in mid-1964, proved to be only the
beginning. A year later, Congress complemented it with a far-reaching
Voting Rights Act. In turn, these laws were part of a surge of
domestic legislation that was virtually unparalleled. Trust in
government was at a peak, and President Johnson, supported by
powerful majorities within a willing House and Senate, would make the
most of this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aid to education topped his list of
priorities; over 40 bills dealt with this topic. Congress enacted a
law establishing Medicare, which complemented Social Security in
addressing the needs of retirees. Johnson had declared war on
poverty; Congress responded with a law that set up a new Office of
Economic Opportunity, with the rural poor of Appalachia as a
particular concern. Other bills established a National Foundation for
the Arts and Humanities and a Cabinet-level Department of Housing and
Urban Development. Still others fought heart disease, stroke, and
cancer. A new immigration law opened the door to newcomers from Asia,
heralding a change in the centuries-old predominance of immigration
from Europe. To pay for it all, Johnson won a major tax cut that
would stimulate economic growth. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Johnson was not about to promote these new
programs at the expense of existing ones; hence NASA and Apollo would
receive their due. As the nation turned its attention toward these
domestic concerns, however, it became
[<A NAME="159"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">159</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] increasingly clear that Apollo represented a response
to a Soviet challenge that was about to run its course. Apollo was a
creation of its time, and by decade's end that time had come and
gone. Events soon demonstrated that Apollo was a program that the
nation would neither renew nor long continue. In turn, these events
weighed heavily upon Paine's pursuit of Mars. They took the form of
budget cuts, imposed within the BoB.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mars: The Advance</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Gettysburg in 1863, General George Pickett
led a charge that reached the top of Cemetery Ridge, only to be
driven back by superior strength. NASA's pursuit of Mars would show a
similar character, with the contested ground being the budget
allocation for FY 1971. NASA accounted for some two percent of the
federal budget. While this was far below the allocations of the
Pentagon or Health, Education, and Welfare, it was enough to justify
the continuing attention of small groups of staffers within both the
White House and the BoB.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Peter Flanigan, Assistant to the President,
served as the White House link to NASA. He reported directly to Nixon
and was one of the more powerful of the presidential assistants.
Flanigan had been a Wall Street investment banker; his father had
been chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. Following Nixon's
election, Flanigan had drawn on his broad social and professional
acquaintances and had recruited some 300 appointees for high-level
Administration positions. His White House responsibilities were
correspondingly broad, and he relied on five staff assistants. These
included Clay Whitehead, a graduate of MIT, who dealt with the space
program as part of his day-to-day concerns. Whitehead had worked on
Apollo at the Rand Corp. and helped to plug gaps in Flanigan's
experience, for Flanigan had no prior background in space.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the BoB, the director Robert Mayo and
his deputy, James Schlesinger, were the only political appointees;
the rest of the Bureau consisted of permanent Civil Service staff.
Schlesinger was also a Rand Corp. alumnus; he worked closely with
Whitehead during 1969 in reviewing the NASA budget. This budget fell
within the purview of BoB's Economics, Science and Technology
Programs Division, where a small professional group specialized in
the pertinent issues. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="160"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">160</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The Space Task
Group (STG) was to submit its report to Nixon in September 1969, in
time for its recommendations to influence the FY 1971 budget that
Nixon would send to Capitol Hill the following February. However,
initial exchanges concerning this budget were under way as early as
April 1969, barely two months after the inauguration. On April 4,
Mayo sent a letter to Paine that asked: "Should the U.S. undertake
the development of a long duration manned orbital space station in
the FY 1971-73 period?" Attached to this letter was a full page of
questions. Paine had recently tried to bypass the budget process by
seeking Nixon's approval for a space station in his memo of February
26, but Mayo's letter showed that Paine could still hope to win
approval by working within this process. The list of questions
amounted to an invitation to justify such a project in detail, with
an understanding that when NASA made its case, Mayo's staff would
give it close scrutiny. The BoB would give particular attention to
its cost. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the work of the STG was separate from
the budget process, the two activities went forward in parallel. On
June 11, Nixon sent a memo to Mayo that made his own attitude
perfectly clear: </FONT></P>

   and agencies that the budget going to Congress will be my budget

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The NASA appropriation for FY 1970 was $3.7
billion. Whitehead noted that "the President is personally interested
in a serious evaluation of several alternative NASA budget levels,
including one in the vicinity of $2.5 to $3 billion." He proposed
that "you or I call Bob Mayo to emphasize the importance" of treating
such a level as a formal budget option. He also suggested that
Flanigan send a memo to Nixon recommending "that NASA be calmed down
during the enthusiasm of Apollo 11, pending a systematic review this
fall." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo was not about to chop NASA down to $2.5

   restricting Presidential options. According to Dr. Schlesinger,
   Mr. Flanigan believes the President would like options even lower
   than $2.5 billion. Also according to Dr. Schlesinger, Mr. Flanigan
   is basing his comments on personal conversation with the
   President. In the light of these events, Dr. Schlesinger asked me
   to define a $1.5 billion per year space program.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One alternative, at $3.5 billion per year,
eliminated NERVA and stopped production of Saturn V and Apollo
spacecraft. This option, however, would maintain a vigorous program
in piloted flight, featuring Skylab with three visits as well as six
additional Apollo lunar missions. Better yet, such a budget would
accommodate "Space Transportation System and Space Station module
development with launch of both in 1979."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two other options, at $2.5 billion, also
permitted flight of Skylab with its three visits, along with the six
Apollos. There could even be a space station in 1980, with Titan
III-Gemini for logistics. However, there would be no space shuttle.
NASA-Marshall would close, while activity at the Manned Spacecraft
Center would fall substantially.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At $1.5 billion, the piloted space program
would shut down entirely: "All manned space flight ceases with Apollo
14 in July 1970." Not only NASA-Marshall but the Manned Spacecraft
Center would close, with the Saturn launch facilities at Cape
Canaveral shutting down as well. Yet NASA would continue to maintain
a vigorous program of automated space flight. Even at $1.5 billion,
the agency could send six Viking landers to Mars, and could take
advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to send spacecraft
to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. NASA would conduct
"at least one planetary launch each year in the decade," and would
pursue "a relatively ambitious science and applications program with
95 launches in the decade." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

contrast, were two visions for NASA's future: Paine's, who hoped for
as much as $10 billion and an early expedition to Mars, versus
Mayo's, who would consider cuts to one-seventh of that level and a
total shutdown of piloted flight. Yet while such options might
represent the shape of things to come, Mayo, at least for the moment,
would give Paine considerable leeway to argue for his preferred
budget. If Paine's arguments proved inadequate then Mayo could lower
the boom. However, he would not hasten to do this.</FONT></P>

be available for NASA under the current fiscal outlook for 1971." He
also proposed an "alternative target" that represented "a higher

assumed that both budget categories would remain constant at $3.5
billion per year from 1972 to 1978. This would impose a new cut,
because the FY 1978 budget stood at $3.7 billion. The alternative
target, however, assumed a gradual rise to $6 billion in 1978 that
would allow Paine to get a head start toward Mars. Moreover, Mayo
suggested in his letter that he might be even more generous: "If you
feel that you must request 1971 budget authority or outlays greater
than either of these planning figures, you may, of course, do so."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Given an inch, Paine would willingly take
enough miles to reach the planets. He proceeded to disregard both
Mayo's opening paragraphs, with their words of caution, and his
official target of $3.5 billion. Instead, Paine instructed his
associates to prepare their final FY 1971 budget proposals in
accordance with Program B within his position paper for the STG. This
plan aimed to reach Mars as early as 1983, and represented the option
that he hoped Nixon would approve. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine also faced the issue of having the STG
accept his position paper as the basis for the official report that
would go to Nixon. The staffer Russell Drew prepared a draft of this
report; it was ready on August 27. The members of the STG - Paine,
Agnew, DuBridge, Seamans - met anew on September 3, and reached
agreement on several basic principles, with all members concurring.
This had the important consequence that the STG would not present
majority and minority views, but would stand united behind their
final report.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">They agreed that any program they might
recommend was not to include merely the use of existing capability
such as Skylab, Titan III, and Saturn V; it was to include the
development of new capability. In particular, the STG accepted the
eventual development of both the space station and Space Shuttle.
This represented a defeat for Seamans, who had rejected the station
and had accepted the shuttle only with misgivings. Nevertheless,
Seamans agreed not to press his objections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The members also accepted the concept of an
eventual expedition to Mars as the focus for development of the new
capability. However, they did not specify the meaning of "eventual,"
other than to say that it would be prior to the year 2000. This
brought DuBridge into the fold, as he too accepted the goal of
Mars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="165"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">165</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Mayo, sitting with
the STG as an observer, insisted that the report present a low-cost
option that would reflect Nixon's suggestions. DuBridge agreed with
Mayo, and Paine agreed to add another alternative, Plan E. It
resembled the BoB options at the $2.5 billion level, protecting
Apollo and Skylab but shutting down piloted flight. This option
offered neither the station nor the Shuttle. However, it did include
a strong program of automated spacecraft, with emphasis on planetary
missions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within these options, now numbering five,
Paine and Agnew still hoped to have the report include a strong
recommendation for Plan B. The full STG finessed this issue by
agreeing not to recommend any particular program to Nixon. This
allowed each member to maintain his own views of appropriate budgets,
schedules, and pace, without requiring anyone to yield to others.

what happened in his memoirs:</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">One morning in early September 1969 I
   had to leave the senior staff meeting early to go see the Vice
   President. Peter Flanigan had alerted me that Agnew's Space
   Advisory Committee [sic] was about to make some recommendations to
   the President that Flanigan knew Nixon could not live with. Peter
   had been unsuccessful in dissuading the President's science
   advisor, Lee DuBridge, from agreeing with the staff of Agnew's
   Advisory Committee that there should be a very costly manned
   mission to the planet Mars in 1981. So Flanigan had asked for a
   meeting with Agnew, the ex-officio chairman of the committee, in
   the hope that we could persuade him to kill it.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I had read a briefing paper on the
   question the evening before, and it seemed obvious to me that
   Agnew and DuBridge owed it to the President not to include a
   proposal our budget couldn't pay for. A Mars space shot would be
   very popular with many people. If the committee proposed it and
   Nixon had to say no, he would be criticized as the President who
   kept us from finding life on Mars. On the other hand, if the
   committee didn't recommend it, we avoided the problem
   altogether.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">DuBridge was perhaps to be forgiven for
   failing to understand such a political argument, but I saw no

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I had been wooed by NASA, the Space
   Administration, but not to the degree to which they had made love
   to Agnew. He had been their guest of honor at space launchings,
   tours and dinners, and it seemed to me they had done a superb job
   of recruiting him to lead this fight to vastly expand their empire
   and budget.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I finally took off the kid gloves:
   "Look, Mr. Vice President, we have to be practical. There is no
   money for a Mars trip. The President has already decided that. So
   the President does not want such a trip in the Space Advisory
   Committee's recommendations. It is your job, with Lee DuBridge's
   help, to make absolutely certain that the Mars trip is not in
   there."</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mr. Agnew was not happy to be told what
   to do by me. He demanded a personal meeting with the President.
   This was a matter for Constitutional Officers to
   discuss.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I overlooked the obvious innuendo that

   I said. "I'll arrange it at once, and someone will call
   you."</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Flanigan and I left Agnew about 9:45
   a.m. At 10:00 a.m. the Vice President called me. He had decided to

   category headed "Technically Feasible."</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The STG staff proceeded to modify the draft of
the final report, but only slightly. NASA's Plan A, with its mission
to Mars in 1981, lost the status of a formal option. Plan E, which
excluded new programs in piloted space flight, also was downgraded.
This left Plans B, C, and D, which were redesignated as Options I,
II, and III. Because the middle option would remain the one for Nixon
to choose if he wished, this reshuffle amounted to delaying the Mars
mission from 1983 to 1986 - but retaining this expedition as the
centerpiece. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B>

report thus showed a close similarity to NASA's position paper of a
month earlier. Plan A, with Mars in 1981, appeared with the
designation "Maximum Pace." The STG rejected it with regret,
presenting it "only to demonstrate the upper bound of technological
achievement." Plan E, described as "Low Level," was one with which
"the interests of this Nation would not be served."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With these caveats, the report presented
Mueller's integrated plan in full. It described the major elements:
space shuttle, space tug, nuclear shuttle, space station module. In
turn, these would represent "development of new capabilities for
operating in space." The three main options would lift NASA's budget
from its 1970 level respectively to $5.5, $7.65 and $9.4 billion, a
decade later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Graphs, published with the report, presented
curves of funding for all five plans, giving particular attention to
the three main options. Separate curves traced funding levels through
1979 for Plan C; they showed clearly that the Shuttle and station,
pursued concurrently, would dominate expenditures for new starts
through 1976. Their costs would then diminish, while spending for
additional new starts - space base, space tug, nuclear shuttle, lunar
orbiting station - would rise rapidly to prominence. Spending for a
1986 Mars expedition would also increase sharply beginning in 1978.

well with STG members and observers, giving them opportunities to
comment. These panelists stated that they had rejected the "extreme
options" of Mars in 1981 and of eliminating plans for post-Apollo
piloted programs. Nixon's press secretary, Ronald Ziegler, then
reported that the President "had concurred wholeheartedly in the

response fell well short of a Kennedy-type commitment to Mars, even
as an option for future presidents, it did represent a significant
straw in the wind. By endorsing the STG's rejection of Plan E, with
its phaseout of piloted flight, Nixon hinted for the first time that
he would want more than the Apollo and Skylab missions that he had
inherited from previous administrations. He would want a piloted
program of his own, and Agnew, as brash as Paine in these matters,
promptly sent a letter to Nixon that strongly recommended Plan C
(designated Option II in the report), which anticipated Mars in 1986.
This letter amounted to an endorsement of Mueller's integrated plan
in its original version, which had also called for Mars in 1986.
Paine received the bolder thinking for which he had called. It was
clear, however, that this boldness had merely given him leeway to
back off to the far-reaching plan that Mueller had proposed in the
first place. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">27</FONT></SUP></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When Nixon met with the STG, Robert Mayo was
among those present. He did not need to say much. Everyone knew he
had the authority to deal with NASA in his own good way. He already
had a staff report that came close to asserting that NASA should
follow Plan E, or something very similar. This report had outlined
the consequences of holding NASA to future budgets as low as $1.5
billion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This staff report treated the Space Shuttle at
some length, comparing it with upgrades of the Titan III as an
alternative. It concluded that even with an active flight schedule of
55 flights per year, the Titan III would represent the less costly
way to proceed, with its advantage growing markedly at lower flight
rates. The reason for this was that while the Shuttle would reduce
the cost of space flight, it would take time and cost money to
develop. To the BoB, dollars in future years held less value than
present dollars. This was not due to inflation, but rather it
reflected the fact that those future dollars would have to earn
interest to match the worth of present ones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA had proposed that the Shuttle replace
most of the expendable boosters that were currently in use, excluding
only the Saturn V. Mayo's staff doubted that NASA and the Pentagon in
fact would do this, even if a shuttle became
[<A NAME="171"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">171</FONT></B><FONT

planetary expedition (Mars) goal either with or without a target
date. In summary, we believe the Mars goal to be much more beneficial
to the space program than to the nation as a whole."</FONT></P>

   addition, missions that are designed around man's unique
   capabilities appear to have little demonstrable economic or social
   return to atone for their high cost. Their principal contribution
   is that each manned flight paves the way for more manned

staff review, Mayo wrote a letter to Nixon on September 25,
presenting the BoB's assessment of the final STG report. He described
it as having "several shortcomings" that "impair its completeness as
a vehicle for your </FONT><I><FONT

</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo noted an excessively narrow scope that
ignored "the relative standing of the space program in our full range
of national priorities" as well as "the future economic context
within which the recommended space expenditure increases would have
to be considered." He suggested that Nixon have the report reviewed
by the Cabinet and perhaps the National Security Council as well.
Such reviews would take time, and would give Nixon excellent reason
to avoid rushing into any hasty commitments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo then warned that the report's estimates
of the costs of future programs appeared to be "significantly
underestimated." He also had other words of caution:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This letter, circulated within the White
House, drew a succinct response from Ehrlichman: "I concur with the
Director's recommendations." It also won support from Henry
Kissinger, the national security advisor and head of
[<A NAME="174"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">174</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] the National Security Council.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> With this, Mayo
was ready to receive Paine's budget request for FY 1971.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine had begun by assembling his associates'
wish list that totaled $5.4 billion and included $1.0 billion in new
starts. This was too much even for him; he responded that their
requests were "not consistent with the recommendations made to the
President" by the STG, and "far exceed the dollar level that can be
reasonably expected." He met with his colleagues, cut their dollar
amounts, and presented his proposed budget to Mayo in a letter dated
October 8. Paine requested $4.2 billion in outlays and $4.497 billion
in new budget authority, with these levels matching those of the
"alternative budget" in Mayo's letter of late July.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo and his staff, however, had no intention
of granting such largesse. In a staff paper dated November 13, the
BoB gave NASA a tentative allowance of $3.349 billion in budget
authority and $3.515 billion in outlays. The first of these would
require congressional appropriation; it represented a cut of over a
billion dollars or more than 25 percent in Paine's request.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such a budget meant that, at least in FY 1971,
NASA would receive no commitment to either a space station or a
shuttle. It would cut the launch rate for Apollo missions to as low
as one flight per year, and would slam the door on continued
production of the Saturn V. It would so restrict NASA that it would
prohibit any new starts even in automated spacecraft.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine hit the roof. In a letter to Mayo on
November 18, he declared that "the allowance and rationale are both
unacceptable." He then followed standard procedure by filing a
"reclama," a request for review. This too was part of the budget
process; it was far from unusual for a department or agency head to
receive a cut in a proposed budget. Rather than compromise, however,
Paine stuck to his guns, and to his requested budget levels. He got
nowhere in a November 21 meeting with Mayo. One participant states
that the meeting "broke fairly quickly because we couldn't
accommodate anything." Another participant adds that Paine "went away
angry." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">33</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One should not see this as a personal fight
between Paine and Mayo. Paine later noted that "Bob Mayo's son has
his wall plastered with NASA [<A NAME="175"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">175</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] posters," adding
that while Mayo was "a little hard-headed about things," he was "an
easy person to get to know. I was always very comfortable going over
and talking to Bob." Rather than keep matters at an impasse, they now
agreed that NASA and BoB staffers were to work together to try to
narrow their differences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo proceeded to raise NASA's allowance to
$3.7 billion, matching the appropriation for FY 1970. Paine's staff
developed alternative budgets that ran as low as $3.91 billion,
though he insisted to Mayo that an appropriation of $4.25 billion "is
the lowest level you and I can responsibly recommend to the
President." This left a gap of over half a billion dollars between
their positions. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The reclama procedure called for Mayo to meet
personally with Nixon to present the BOB's budget recommendation, and
then to inform Nixon of areas of disagreement between BOB and the
agency. Paine was not to be present; Nixon did not wish to act as a
referee. The meeting took place on December 5. Three days later,
Paine talked by telephone with Flanigan, who presented Nixon's
decision: "The President says that he doesn't have enough money
within the next couple of years and must accept limitation of
activity, doing the best he can within the $3.7 limitation." Nixon
had come down strongly on the side of Mayo. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">35</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine still had one more card to play, as he
wrote to Nixon directly, urging a "curtailed and spartan" level of
$4.075 billion that would keep the Saturn V in production, or a level
of $3.935 billion that would suspend Saturn V production but provide
startup funds for a space station and shuttle. The two men met just
before Christmas, and again Nixon stood firm. Paine would have to
accept the BoB figures of $3.7 billion in budget authority and $3.825
billion in outlays. These were the numbers that would go to Congress
in the President's budget. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">36</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ordinarily that would have been the end of the
matter, with NASA absorbing this cut and making the best of it. In
fact, the cuts for FY 1971 were only beginning, and the first new one
came from Flanigan. He had tried to develop an independent White
House view of an appropriate NASA budget, with his
[<A NAME="176"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">176</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] staff member Clay Whitehead digging into details of
this agency's projects. In a letter to Nixon, Paine had warned that
at $3.7 billion, "U.S. manned flight activity would end in 1972 with
an uncertain date for resumption many years in the future." Flanigan
and Whitehead wondered if things were really that serious.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As they pursued their investigations, they
became convinced that NASA indeed could live with $3.7 billion, could
even receive a budget below that level and still avoid dire
consequences. Flanigan advised Ehrlichman of this. Ehrlichman also
received counsel from another presidential advisor, Bryce Harlow,
liaison with Congress, who warned that a $3.7 billion figure would
not win support on Capitol Hill. Ehrlichman discussed the matter with
Nixon, and they agreed to seek further cuts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Amid a flurry of activity within the White
House and BoB, Paine soon learned that the $3.7 billion figure that
he could not live with now stood at a level higher than what he would
have to accept. Early in January 1970, Flanigan presented the news:
$3.53 in budget authority, $3.6 billion in outlays. The latter figure
represented a cut of $225 million from an earlier estimate of $3.825
billion in outlays. Flanigan's memo also stated that "there is no
commitment, implied or otherwise, for development starts for either
the space station or the shuttle in FY 72. That is a matter to be
discussed when the "72 budget is developed." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">37</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine's initial response was to order the
closing of the Electronics Research Center, a NASA facility in
Cambridge, MA. Though it was not a center on a par with the likes of
NASA-Marshall, it had a staff of 800 and would be missed. Paine then
held a press conference on January 13. He stated that total
employment, within NASA and its contractors, would fall from 190,000
to 140,000 during 1971. (As recently as 1966, this total had
approached 400,000.) Production of the Saturn V would cease, Apollo
lunar missions would fly only at six-month intervals, and Viking
missions to Mars would fly in 1975 rather than in 1973, as earlier
planned. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, back at the White House, a Cabinet
meeting was reaching decisions that would lead to further cuts. The
economist Arthur Burns, a presidential counselor, had urged Nixon to
bring the overall federal budget into
[<A NAME="177"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">177</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] line with new and lower estimates of revenue. He had
won support from George Romney, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development. Romney now called for a uniform reduction of 2.5 percent
in all department budgets, along with restrictions on salaries and
pay raises. On January 13, as Paine was meeting the press, Nixon met
with his cabinet officers and directed them to make such cuts. He put
Burns in charge of this effort, which they called Operation Paring
Knife.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon directed Mayo to inform Paine that NASA
would have to reduce its budget by another $200 million. Paine
received the news just as he was arriving at a banquet. He later
recalled that </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">while I grandly entered this big
   ballroom for this event the loudspeaker boomed out that I was to

   </FONT></I><B><I><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">39</FONT></SUP></I></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine tried to get by with a cut of only $51
million; Mayo agreed to present this to Nixon. Paine told Flanigan of
this, and Flanigan responded angrily, "You mean Mayo capitulated?"
But Paine's ploy collapsed within hours, as Nixon rejected his
compromise. Paine now had no choice but to take the full reduction of
$200 million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This left NASA with $3.33 billion in budget
authority and $3.4 billion in outlays. As recently as October, Paine
had requested $4.497 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. This
budget authority represented a cut of 10 percent from the FY 1970
appropriation of $3.697 billion, with inflation eroding its value
further. This was merely Nixon's requested budget; Congress was free
to make further cuts. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Turn of Congress</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Budget Bureau was part of the permanent
Washington bureaucracy, staffed by members of the Civil Service who
took pride in a tradition of nonpartisan concern for the national
interest. By contrast, Congress was as
[<A NAME="178"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">178</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] partisan an institution as that city could offer. Its
members paid keen attention to public opinion. When Agnew showed up
at the Apollo 11 launch and called for flight to Mars, key senators
were quick to respond.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mike Mansfield, the Senate Majority Leader,
declared that he would rule out such efforts "until problems here on
earth are solved." Following the safe return of the Apollo 11
astronauts, Clinton Anderson, chairman of the Senate space committee,
stated that "now is not the time to commit ourselves to the goal of a
manned mission to Mars." Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican
member of that committee, added that the government "should avoid
making long-range plans during this emotional period," following the
first moon landing. She warned against becoming involved "in a crash
program without the justification we had for Apollo."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">41</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was similar sentiment in the House.
Congressman George Miller, chairman of that chamber's space
committee, warned against decisions that would "commit ourselves to a
specific time period for setting sail for Mars" and proposed that
such decisions might be deferred until "five, perhaps ten years from
now." Joseph Karth, a space subcommittee chairman, asserted that the
success of Apollo would not "translate directly into an urgent
mandate to put a man on Mars by 1980 or, for that matter, any other
magical date." He declared that NASA was showing "complete lack of
consideration for the taxpayer." Congressman Olin Teague, chairman of
the powerful Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight, said a year later
that "the easiest thing on earth to vote against in Congress is the
space program. You can vote to kill the whole space program tomorrow,
and you won't get one letter." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">42</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These people were members and leaders of the
congressional space committees. If they were willing to take such
candid views, what would the rank and file do within the House and
Senate? Certainly they would pay close attention to public-opinion
polls - which were strongly adverse to NASA. Following Apollo 11, a
Gallup Poll took a nationwide survey of views concerning flight to
Mars. Fifty-three percent of the respondents were opposed to such a
program; 39 percent were in favor. A few weeks later, a
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Newsweek</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">
poll [<A NAME="179"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">179</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] found that 56
percent of the public wanted Nixon to spend less on space. Only 10
percent wanted him to spend more. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Paine did what he could to plead his
case, he faced entrenched opposition. He met with Senator Edward
Kennedy, brother of the late President, and suggested that Apollo
astronauts might carry some memento of JFK to the moon. He quickly
learned that the senator had no interest "in identifying Jack Kennedy
at all with this landing. He more or less gave me the impression that
he felt that this was one of President Kennedy's aberrations."</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unable to sway his critics, Paine soon was
dismissing them out of hand: </FONT></P>

   because we went to the moon, and by God, if we had only spent that
   money on all these other things that we needed to do, then we

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon sent his budget for FY 1971 to Capitol
Hill on February 2, 1970. The first step was for the space committees
to hold hearings, where NASA's officials included a new Associate
Administrator for Manned Space Flight. George Mueller, who had held
that post since 1963, resigned from NASA in December 1969 and left
government service to become a vice president at General Dynamics.
His replacement, Dale Myers of NAA, had managed the Navaho missile
program in the long ago. Myers had been a vice president in the Space
Division and had been general manager of Apollo. He also had directed
his company's studies of the Space Shuttle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now, in congressional testimony, he spoke of a
"shuttle/station" and described it as a single integrated program,
offering "the first elements of a transportation system." The shuttle
would "transport a crew of two, and
[<A NAME="180"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">180</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] twelve passengers, into low orbit." In addition to
supporting the station, it would accomplish "propellant delivery,
satellite repair, short-duration orbital missions, deployment of
satellites," and the launch of automated "planetary probes."</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The space station would have a crew of 12,
"seven men working and five men operating the vehicle itself," and
would have "an operational life of ten years, with resupply." It
would fly atop a Saturn V, with both the Shuttle and station entering
service by 1978. Significantly, Myers noted that the FY 1971 budget
held no funds for even preliminary studies of a piloted mission to
Mars. NASA officials understood that such studies and plans could
only hurt the agency. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">45</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA was requesting $110 million for the
Shuttle/station, up from $18.5 million in FY 1970. These funds would
pay for extensive design work on both projects, including early work
on a new engine for the Shuttle. In its original proposal to the BOB
in October 1969, NASA had requested over $250 million for these
projects. Olin Teague, the most powerful of the space subcommittee
chairmen and a power within the full committee as well, was in an
expansive mood and was far from willing to accept the BoB's cuts.
Proposing to add $80 million for the Shuttle/station, he asked Myers
what NASA would do if it had more money for piloted space flight. "I
don't think we have to rubber-stamp something the Bureau of the
Budget does," he argued. </FONT></P>

   every damn thing we do? We are right, you know we are right, and

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The structure of the House space committee
paralleled that of NASA. NASA had a powerful Office of Manned Space
Flight and a much less influential Office of Space Science and
Applications (OSSA) that dealt with automated spacecraft. These
offices had counterparts among the House subcommittees, with Teague
chairing the one on piloted space flight. A separate
[<A NAME="181"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">181</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] subcommittee dealt with the concerns of OSSA; its
chairman was Joseph Karth. Karth lacked the clout of Teague, much as
OSSA had to defer to OMSF. Nevertheless, he was ready to confront
Teague, and NASA, when he felt this was necessary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With their automated orbiters and landers, the
Viking missions to Mars fell within Karth's purview. However, he
strongly opposed piloted flight to that planet. In 1967, he had been
working to win support for Voyager, with its even more ambitious
orbiters and landers, when he learned that NASA was requesting
proposals for studies of piloted missions to Mars and Venus. He
stated that this act left him "absolutely astounded. Very bluntly, a
manned mission to Mars or Venus by 1975 or 1977 is now and always has
been out of the question - and anyone who persists in this kind of
misallocation of resources at this time is going to be stopped."
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">47</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He responded similarly to the work of the STG.
In March 1970, addressing a meeting of the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, he described its plans as </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">totally unrealistic. Based on my
   experience with Ranger, Centaur, Surveyor, Mariner, Viking and
   even Explorer, NASA's projected cost estimates are asinine. NASA
   must consider the members of Congress a bunch of stupid idiots.
   Worse yet, they may believe their own estimates - and then we
   really are in bad shape.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He opposed Teague's motion in committee, and
when Teague prevailed, nailing the $80 million increase to the
authorization bill, Karth took his opposition to the floor of the
House. Teague viewed this as an unprecedented breach of congressional
practice, for Karth, who chaired a subcommittee that did not deal
with piloted space flight and who had not participated in the
hearings of Teague's own subcommittee, was taking a strong stand
against the recommendations of that subcommittee of which he was not
a member. Teague became so angry that he vowed that, although Karth
was among the most senior members of the full committee, he would
personally see to it that Karth would never become its chair.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Karth's amendment called not only for the
elimination of Teague's $80 million increase; it demanded elimination
of all funds for the Shuttle/station,
[<A NAME="182"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">182</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] and chopped another $50 million from piloted space
programs as well. The entire House took up this amendment on April
23, with Karth insisting that NASA's plans were premature: "Before
the Space Shuttle can be a reality, many difficult technological
advances must be made in such areas as configuration and
aerodynamics, heat protection, guidance and control, and propulsion."
Then he dropped a bombshell, suggesting that approval of the
Shuttle/station would necessarily imply much more: "This in my
judgment at least - and there is a great deal of evidence to support
the theory - is the beginning of a manned Mars landing program." He
spoke of a "back door" to that planet, adding that a decision to
"embark upon a $50 billion to $100 billion manned space flight
landing program to Mars is something I think we ought to debate loud
and clear."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The House had no love for Mars; indeed, even
the automated Viking program was controversial. Congressman Edward
Koch, a member of Karth's subcommittee and a future mayor of New York
City, had stated, "I just can't for the life of me see voting for
monies to find out whether or not there is some microbe on Mars, when
in fact I know there are rats in the Harlem apartments." In the floor
debate, however, the BoB's budget cuts now worked ironically in
NASA's favor, for these cuts had eliminated all funds directed toward
such a piloted expedition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"There is no money in here for a manned trip
to Mars," countered Don Fuqua, a member of Teague's subcommittee. A
Republican member, Richard Roudebush, added: "I am puzzled by the
statement that the Shuttle is in some way mixed up with the Mars
landing, when nothing is further from the truth." George Miller,
chairman of the full committee, also stated authoritatively that
there was no relation between the Shuttle/station and a Mars
expedition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These reassurances helped to defeat Karth's
amendment, but only by the narrowest of margins. Only about
one-fourth of the 435 members of the House were present and voting,
and the final tally was a tie: 53 for, 53 against. Under House rules,
this meant it had failed to pass. Other amendments followed, along
with other votes, but the opponents of NASA went down to defeat more
handily. The full $190 million for the Shuttle/station survived to
face new opposition in the Senate. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="183"></A></FONT><B><FONT

Walter Mondale was a Democrat of Minnesota, with the two men being
close colleagues. The Senate had no counterpart of Olin Teague, no
one who would push successfully to add funds for the Shuttle/station
in the authorization bill; the bill that reached the Senate floor
contained only the Administration request of $110 million. Mondale
nevertheless moved to strike this entire amount, and offered an
impassioned plea: </FONT></P>

   profound decision about the future direction of the manned space
   flight era. This is, in fact, the next moon-type program. I
   believe it would be unconscionable to embark on a project of such
   staggering cost when many of our citizens are malnourished, when
   our rivers and lakes are polluted, and when our cities and rural
   areas are dying. What are our values? What do we think is more
   important?</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">49</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Senate debated Mondale's amendment for
four hours, then sent it to defeat by a vote of 29 to 56. Mondale
tried anew in July, when this chamber turned to the appropriations
bill. This bill totalled nearly $18 billion and included funds not
only for NASA but for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. Senators thus faced a potentially irresistible
opportunity to add funds to meet the needs of the nation's cities,
and to subtract funds from the space program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mondale's colleagues quickly did the former,
adding $400 million for urban renewal and for sewer and water
projects. Mondale then offered his amendment again, as he sought to
delete the $110 million for the Shuttle/station as an appropriation.
After several hours of debate, his amendment lost - by a margin of
only 28 to 32.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With debate resuming the next day, Paine knew
that he faced an imminent threat from similar amendments. He
discussed the situation at a meeting on Capitol Hill with Senator
Hugh Scott, the Republican leader. In Paine's words, </FONT></P>

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Senate appropriations bill called for a
level of spending slightly below the President's budget, and they
decided to seek a member of the Senate space committee who would
introduce an amendment to bring it back up to Nixon's request of
$3.333 billion. They quickly settled on Barry Goldwater, an active
space proponent, as the man they wanted. At that moment, Goldwater
was on the Senate floor; they sent him a note, and he met Paine and
Scott in the latter's office. He agreed with the strategy and invited
them to prepare an amendment that he would introduce.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We went into the outer office," Paine
recalls. "We got the girl to put an amendment form into the
typewriter there, and she banged out an amendment. Barry folded it
up, put it in his pocket, and walked out." Scott then invoked Senate
procedure and arranged for Goldwater to introduce his measure after
everyone was back from lunch. It met resounding defeat, 15 to 58 - as
Paine had expected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following this vote, NASA's opponents launched
their onslaught. William Proxmire, an ally of Mondale and a strong
critic of NASA in his own right, noted that the House had approved a
NASA budget that was $136 million below the Administration request.
This cut had not been aimed specifically at the Shuttle/station, but
had been spread among a variety of programs. Proxmire now introduced
his own amendment, calling for a cut to this level in the Senate
appropriation. He asserted that the money saved could "provide a
subsidy for the building of some 125,000 to 150,000 new low- and
moderate-income housing units." This amendment also failed, 34 to
39.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Senator William Fulbright then introduced yet
another amendment, demanding a cut of $300 million for NASA. Nixon
had described the Senate as "spendthrift" for having added $400
million to the bill the previous day, for urban programs. "We should
all have an opportunity to help balance the current bill," this
senator said, adding that his cut in funding for the space program
would do precisely that. He presented an explicit appeal to take
money from NASA and spend it on the cities: "We voted for sewers.
Certainly sewers are more important than going to the moon." Again
Paine found the support he needed as Fulbright's measure went down,
32 to 37.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The final Senate appropriation passed easily,
68 to 4. It provided $3.319 billion for NASA, for a cut of only $14
million from the President's budget. This bill went to conference
with that of the House; the conferees gave NASA a final appropriation
of $3.269 billion. They also granted $110 million for the
Shuttle/station, eliminating Teague's proposed increase but matching
Nixon's original request. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">50</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This appropriation represented a drop of $428
million from the level of FY 1970, with inflation reducing the 1971
allocation even further. It marked the fourth year in a row of such
cuts, and while no one had a crystal ball, this budget at least would
offer the solace that future cuts would be considerably less severe.
NASA funding finally hit rock bottom in FY 1974, barely above $3
billion. In constant dollars, this represented only one-third of
NASA's peak in the [<A NAME="186"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">186</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] mid-1960s.
Subsequent budgets stayed close to that level, with adjustment for
inflation, and continued at that constant-dollar level through the
mid-1980s. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet even in 1970 the final cut, from $3.333
billion to $3.269 billion, gave a clear view of congressional
attitudes toward Apollo and, by extension, to the challenges that
might lie beyond the moon. This reduction of $64 million represented
only two percent of the Administration request, but NASA was already
so hard-pressed that it had significant consequences. Paine now saved
$42 million by canceling two planned Apollo moon landings. This
amounted to a down payment; those two missions would have cost $800
million, spread over several years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Apollo program had spent $23.85 billion
through mid-1970, and had accomplished the two moon landings of
Apollo 11 and 12. The equipment was in hand for six more. Hence, to
save 3.3 percent of the program cost - $800 million out of nearly $24
billion - Paine sacrificed one-third of the remaining missions. The
loss in lunar science was greater still. Lunar landings were visiting
rugged regions of interest to geologists; indeed, a professional
geologist, Harrison Schmitt, flew to the moon aboard Apollo 17. The
final Apollo missions were able to stay longer on the moon, as
astronauts ranged widely by driving a battery-powered vehicle that
resembled a dune buggy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such waste is inconceivable unless one
understands that, to Congress, Apollo was a means to achieve national
prestige. By 1970, the nation had reached the moon and had won
whatever prestige it was likely to get from this. Members of Congress
could look at the moon and say "been there, done that." Each Apollo
flight cost up to $400 million. Such a sum, following the estimate of
Senator Proxmire, could provide housing for as many as a million
people. In an era when people looked to Washington to do such things,
Apollo would fail totally in any competition. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Paine Leaves NASA</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the year that followed the landing of
Apollo 11 in the Sea of Tranquillity, NASA received a cold bath in
the Sea of Reality. Yet the experience
[<A NAME="187"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">187</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] left Paine unmoved; he remained as ebullient as ever
in his hopes. He not only continued to cherish the goals of the STG;
he sought to define further goals reaching to the year 2000, three
decades in the future. He set up a three-day meeting at which space
experts were to brainstorm on such goals; the invitees included
Wernher von Braun, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Gilruth of the Manned
Spacecraft Center, and astronaut Neil Armstrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Calling for "a completely uninhibited flow of
new ideas," Paine offered an "operating manual" for "Spaceship NASA."
He wanted new types of engines, "to achieve Werner's Metaphysical
Goals of extending terrestrial life within the solar system and out
into the galaxy." He hoped for an "Intercontinental Space Plane,"
able to fly "anywhere on earth in an hour." He proposed "Global
Telecommunication/Supercomputer Networks" that indeed would take
shape as the Internet. Another concept called for "Food Manufacture,"
synthesizing food from fossil fuels and "freeing man from his 5000
year dependence on agriculture." The list concluded: "Understand
Man's Origin and Destiny" (that word again). He envisioned "the
future evolution of terrestrial life to other worlds with eventual
communication with other intelligence."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He called for "swashbuckling buccaneering
courage" and proposed "fighting ships: both naval and buccaneering"
as a model for NASA. Having served personally in the Navy, he
proceeded to issue orders:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The meeting took place in mid-June of 1970.
Paine followed with a letter to Nixon: "The results are exciting and
I would like to request an appointment to present to you our best
current thinking.... The purpose is...to give you a heretofore
unavailable Presidential level long-range view of man's future
potential in space." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">53</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then in July, he received an attractive job
offer from Xerox. The offer appealed to him, for his government
salary was $42,500 per year. As he put it, "with four children in
school, I can certainly use a little more money to help support this
family and give them a good start in life." He called Jack Parker at
General Electric, an old friend and a member of the board of
directors, and asked for advice. Parker replied, in Paine's words,
"that they would be very anxious to have me come back," and that GE
might be able to offer him a very promising position. Paine then
talked to the chairman of the board and learned that the position
would call for him "to head up all of General Electric's power
generation activities including both the conventional steam turbine
business and also the nuclear power plants." Paine expressed interest
and suggested that he could take the post early in 1971; the chairman
replied that GE would need him that summer. There was nothing
pressing to keep him at NASA, and on July 28 he sent Nixon his letter
of resignation, to become effective on September 15. Having left GE
only two and a half years earlier, he now returned, with his tenure
at NASA representing merely a brief interlude within a career at GE
that spanned nearly three decades. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">54</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He had been a liberal Democrat in an
administration of Republicans, a Lyndon Johnson appointee held over
to serve Nixon's loyalists. In addition to this, he had spent much
effort fighting for his own agenda, rather than promoting that of the
President. Yet he did not leave Washington under a cloud. Peter
[<A NAME="189"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">189</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] Flanigan described him as a "good soldier" who
"accepted decisions after getting a full hearing." Ehrlichman
compared NASA's bold proposals to a spring that "had to be stretched
in order for it to come back to where it belonged." Nixon, on
receiving Paine's letter of resignation, wrote that "the course you
have done so much to set will help guide our efforts for years to
come." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">55</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">His push for Mars fell short, but even within
the STG report, he expected to defer the serious pursuit of this goal
until 1976. Although Congress and the BoB cut his budget, this
schedule left time for them to experience a change of heart. In the
words of Dale Myers, "Hope springs eternal. After we came off the
Apollo peak, it was very difficult to accept that we'd be at a level
half or a third of that. We always wanted to think that next year
would be better." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">56</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With all his swashbuckling, what did Paine
accomplish at NASA? Though he did not build this agency in the manner
of his predecessor, James Webb, he was the captain on its bridge
during the run-up to the moon landings. He pushed successfully for
the dramatic Apollo 8 mission that orbited the moon at Christmas in
1968; he approved the dry workshop for Skylab. He was at the helm
when the landings took place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Amid his setbacks, Paine followed the lead of
George Mueller and steered NASA onto the new course that Nixon noted.
Mueller had tried and failed to build a major post-Apollo effort,
Apollo Applications, based on use of Saturn-class launchers and
Apollo spacecraft. This effort was in tatters by mid-1968. Mueller
responded by envisioning a space shuttle as a focus for the future.
Paine took this vision, made it his own, encouraged Mueller to
strengthen it with bolder thinking, and sold it to the STG.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though Mars provided a long-term goal, the
Shuttle/station was to represent the main work of the 1970s. When
budget cuts hit home, Paine held to this plan, preserving options for
the future by sacrificing those of the past as he shut down Saturn
production and canceled Apollo moon landings. Congress also signed on
for the Shuttle/station, appropriating $110 million to start the work
during FY 1971.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As that fiscal year began, however, in
mid-1970, NASA's situation was tenuous in the extreme. Funding for
the Shuttle/station had survived by votes of 53-53 in the House and
32-28 in the Senate, which left the program vulnerable
[<A NAME="190"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">190</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] to even a slight increase in anti-space sentiment.
Similarly, Paine had not won the endorsement of Nixon for this
program. Lacking such endorsement, NASA could proceed with detailed
studies of the Shuttle/station, but could not award the contracts
that would build it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Arthur Cleaver, a leader in British rocket
development, quoted the Duke of Wellington in describing the votes in
Congress as "a damn close-run thing - the nearest run thing you ever
saw in your life."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">57</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> If NASA was to
avoid meeting its own Waterloo, it would need new sources of
strength. It would find them by abandoning the plans of the STG,
dropping the space station, placing all hope in the Space Shuttle as
a separate project, and making common cause with the Air
Force.</FONT></P>
