<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="291"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">291</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The poor prospects
for the Space Shuttle, midway through 1971, emerged within a broad
and sweeping downturn within the aerospace industry as a whole. This
industry has long been highly cyclical. For instance, orders for
military aircraft have soared during wars and Air Force buildups,
only to fall off sharply in times of peace. The nation's aerospace
efforts have also included major activities in civil aviation and in
space flight, which at times have tended to counteract downturns on
the military side.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the early 1970s, however, all three of
these industry components went into downturn simultaneously. The
waning of the Vietnam War brought a sharp falloff in military
procurement, which dropped from $23.3 billion in 1968 to $18.4
billion only three years later. The waning of Apollo led to a similar
falloff in NASA employment, which plunged from 394,000 in 1966 to
144,000 in 1971. The nation as a whole went into a recession during
1970, which caused new orders for airliners to dry up as well. This
brought extensive layoffs at Boeing, along with severe distress
within its home city of Seattle. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Total aerospace employment reached a peak of
over 1.4 million in 1967. It then slid downhill very rapidly,
dropping to 900,000 in mid-1971. Employment of production workers
fell by nearly 50 percent, from nearly 800,000 to just over 400,000.
It was nearly as bad for scientists and engineers, as their ranks
dwindled from 235,000 in 1968 to 145,000 four years later.

<HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>
</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Much of this was unavoidable. The nation
certainly was not about to keep the NASA and military programs at
1967 levels merely to maintain full employment within the industry.
In addition to this, the layoffs at Boeing stemmed from a cyclic
downturn in civil aviation. Indeed, the aerospace
[<A NAME="293"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">293</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] recession cut deepest on the commercial side. Three
programs held particular significance: the Boeing 747, the supersonic
transport (SST), and the Lockheed L-1011. The SST and L-1011 also
brought unprecedented forms of federal involvement in commercial
planebuilding. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This involvement proved highly controversial,
and led to a series of close congressional votes during 1971. These
votes made it clear that neither Congress nor the Nixon
Administration would sit back and allow major aerospace corporations
to wither on the vine. Rather, despite heated controversy, Washington
would step in to offer support. With this, the prospects shifted for
aerospace, and for the Shuttle. With the industry taking its lumps,
it lost something of its reputation as a recipient of undeserved
largesse. This made it politically feasible to support the Shuttle,
not with interim funding from one year to the next, but as a
long-term national effort.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Boeing 747</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The background to the 747, and the source of
most of its troubles, lay in its engines. These were of a new type,
known as the high-bypass turbofan. In contrast to earlier jet
engines, which had the long and slender shape of a cigar, they
introduced an enormous and gaping mouth, with a very large rotating
fan in the front. This arrangement produced high thrust with
relatively low noise with excellent fuel economy. The term
"high-bypass" reflected the fact that most of the air blown by the
fan would bypass the engine core, allowing the fan to act as a
high-speed propeller. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the mid-1960s, the Air Force held a
burgeoning interest in such engines, which were to power transport
aircraft of unprecedented size. These would support the policy of
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, whereby the U.S. was to build up
its airlift and sealift capacity to be ready to carry troops and
equipment wherever America might choose to intervene. In August 1965,
the Air Force picked a high-bypass design from General Electric, the
TF-39, and marked it for development. Mounting a fan with diameter of
eight feet, this engine was to produce 40,000 pounds of thrust.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A month later, in September, the Air Force
awarded a contract to Lockheed for the C-5A, the transport that this
engine would power. Newsweek later referred to this aircraft as Moby
Jet. Placed within a football stadium, it would stretch from the goal
line to the opponents' eighteen-yard line. Its wings
[<A NAME="295"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">295</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] would overhang both teams' benches. Its cargo would
accommodate heavily-armored tanks. Fully loaded, its weight of
769,000 pounds would double that of the largest commercial jetliners.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Douglas and Boeing had competed with Lockheed
for this award, coming forth with similar designs. At Boeing, the
immediate question was how to turn such a concept into something that
looked like an airliner. For several reasons, the C-5A as such would
not do. It was too big; it could carry far more passengers than the
market would provide. Its planned cruising speed, 506 mph, would also
be too slow. It would be costly to operate, and its design was to
emphasize the military requirements necessary for operation from
short and unpaved landing strips rather than from hard-surface
airports. Nevertheless, Boeing's work on the C-5A offered a basis for
an airliner that took shape as the 747. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Right at the start, this project held the
strong interest of Juan Trippe, chairman of Pan American World
Airways. Pan Am was the nation's leading overseas carrier. While it
held no domestic routes, in its chosen realm of international travel,
it carried more passengers than all other U.S.-flag airlines
combined. Within the aviation industry, Trippe was a power in his own
right. He had single-handedly launched the jet age, in October 1955,
by placing a $269 million order for Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8
jetliners. Now, a decade later, he had the strength to launch the
747. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">His vice-president of engineering, John
Borger, began talking with Boeing officials on the very day that
Lockheed won the C-5A. Now, by prearrangement, Boeing's
advanced-design policy shifted focus to the 747. The group's manager,
Joseph Sutter, knew he would head up the new project as soon as the
Air Force gave the C-5A to Lockheed. Market projections also favored
the 747-and called for it to be huge in size.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the Boeing vice-president John Steiner
describes it, aircraft are designed to fit the market four years
after they enter service. For the 747, that was to be 1973 or 1974.
Traffic had been shooting up for several years at annual rates of
increase of 10 to 12 percent; lately those rates had gone up further.
Pan Am, carrying nearly six million passengers in 1965, would top the
ten million mark only four years later. Yet, if one projected no more
than that, [<A NAME="296"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">296</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] growth rates would
stay below 12 percent, then airliners delivered in 1970 should
accommodate 350 to 375 people. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An early issue called for selection of an
engine. The big General Electric TF-39 was far from being the obvious
choice. GE's management, believing that this engine would find a
civilian market, expected to pitch it to the airlines after the Air
Force had paid for its basic development. It quickly became apparent,
however, that for the 747, the TF-39 was too noisy. While this
problem was far from insuperable, it would demand a major rework, a
significant civilian effort that would run parallel to the
military's. GE took the view that the Air Force would receive
priority. That did not suit Boeing, and the chance for a deal fell
through.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">GE's main competitor, Pratt &amp; Whitney, had
a different spirit. That firm had built a high-bypass turbofan of its
own for the Air Force engine competition. While it had lost to GE's
TF-39, Pratt's design won new life as an engine for the 747. The
initial concept called for 41,000 pounds of thrust, matching the
performance of the TF-39. Pratt called its engine the JT-9D. In turn,
the selection of Pratt was propitious, for this contractor had a
virtual monopoly (with a market share of some 90 percent) on jetliner
engines that were already in production.. By contrast, GE's strength
lay in military engines. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Boeing, Joe Sutter's engineers proceeded to
prepare design concepts for Trippe's latest world-beater. Initial
thinking, during 1965, held the view that the 747 might emerge as
something resembling a big 707 with a double-deck cabin. Trippe, who
had a strong interest in air freight, insisted, however, that the 747
was to permit easy conversion for use in cargo hauling. His
requirement called for the plane to accommodate two side-by-side rows
of containers of the type that were traveling by ship, rail, and
truck. Their standard dimensions included width and height of eight
feet. To fit them into a fuselage of circular cross section, then,
would require a diameter of 21 feet. Here was the origin of the
wide-body cabin, with its double aisles and ten-abreast seating. It
would give a feeling of spaciousness that travelers would greatly
appreciate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">From this basic decision came others. The 747
might sustain hard landings in which those containers would rip free
of their moorings and hurtle forward with crushing force. Hence it
would be a good idea to put the pilot
[<A NAME="297"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">297</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] and crew out of the way, with the flight deck high
above the cargo deck. That would also offer the opportunity to
install a big upward-swinging nose door for easy loading of freight,
as on the C-5A.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For aerodynamic reasons, however, this flight
deck could not simply sit atop the front fuselage like a camel's
hump. It would have to be faired smoothly with the rest of the
fuselage, sweeping gently to the back. This meant there would be a
good deal of extra space to the rear of the cockpit. Sutter thought
this would be a good place to put air-conditioning ducts. Trippe had
other ideas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some 20 years earlier, Trippe had supported
Boeing in another venture that had built a four-engine airliner
called the Stratocruiser. It had featured a downstairs cocktail
lounge that longtime travelers remembered with pleasure. He now took
the view that a similar lounge in the 747, reached by a spiral
stairway, would be just the thing. In subsequent versions of the 747,
it would grow into a true passenger deck. But even in the earliest
models, this lounge would offer a popular center of cheer.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, other Boeing officials were
addressing the question of where to build their leviathan. The
company's existing production facilities were busy building the 707,
727 and 737; hence Boeing would need new facilities for the 747. The
search for a new plant site led to Everett, a lumber town 30 miles
north of Seattle. The new factory, quite simply, would feature the
largest enclosed space in the world, within a building spanning 40
acres. At Cape Canaveral, the Vehicle Assembly Building had held the
previous record, with 130 million cubic feet under roof; the new
Boeing plant would be 50 percent larger. The completed production
center would span more than a square mile and would have a concrete
apron with room for 20 of the big jets. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then in April 1966, Trippe formally ordered 23
passenger and two freight versions of the 747, for a total of $531
million. A decade earlier, his $269 million jetliner order had set a
record for dollar value; this 1966 order now set a new record. Over
the next three months, five other airlines signed on for 28 more
747s. With these orders, the die was cast. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="298"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">298</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] As the orders
rolled in, however, managers at Boeing and Pan Am followed a course
that soon had the weight of the 747 running badly out of hand.
Initial design decisions had been relatively straightforward, with
the planned weight being 655,000 pounds as of April 1966. Pratt &amp;
Whitney was prepared to accommodate such a design using its proposed
engine, the JT-9D, and expected to increase its power according to a
careful plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When it entered service in 1969, the engine
was to produce 41,000 pounds of thrust. This thrust would increase to
44,000 in new versions planned for 1972. Pratt's designers would do
this by pushing up the turbines' operating temperatures; in essence,
this engine would deliver more power by running hotter. There are,
however, a number of other ways to boost an engine's rated power. The
view within Boeing, strongly encouraged by Pan Am, was that Pratt
could deliver a 44,000 pound engine a lot sooner and enable the 747
to grow larger still.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Once this point of view took hold, Boeing's
managers began acting like kids in a candy store. As early as April
1966, as Trippe was placing his order, Boeing was already
anticipating that the plane's weight would run to 680,000 pounds.
There were plenty of opportunities to go further. For a while, people
talked of putting a swimming pool in the upstairs lounge. Though that
notion fell by the wayside, the cocktail lounge by itself added more
than two tons to the empty weight. More tons went in when Boeing
lengthened the fuselage to accommodate extra seats. The additional
passengers meant larger and heavier galleys for the food service,
which in turn called for weightier structural bracing. The British
airline BOAC declared that noise rules of the London Airport
Authority would demand quieter engines. The 747's engine pods took on
an additional half-ton of sound-absorbing linings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pratt &amp; Whitney now had to play catch-up.
Its basic engine would now be quite inadequate; it had to offer more
thrust, and quickly. In October 1966, Pratt achieved a small rise in
the turbine temperature, pushing the thrust to 42,000 pounds. This
was pushing limits as well and would be all it could offer for a
while.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In June 1967, Bruce Connelly, Boeing's
vice-president of sales, sent a letter to Pan Am's chief technical
managers. He stated that the 747's weight was on its way to 710,000
pounds. Even then, the 747 would be lighter than the C-5A. It was to
fly considerably faster, however, which is why its engines
[<A NAME="299"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">299</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] needed more power. To Pan Am, the 747's weight meant
a cut in the passenger capacity that would slice the profit on each
flight by as much as $20,000. Alternately, the plane would fall short
in range on a number of key overseas routes. Either way, this design
would be unacceptable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Boeing nevertheless hoped that Pan Am would
accept such limitations on the grounds that better engines soon would
restore the 747 to its full promise. Yet, in the words of Laurence
Kuter who headed Trippe's technical staff, </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was no doubt that Pan Am was
   convinced that it was Boeing, not Pan Am, that became pregnant
   when the 747 was conceived. Pan Am expected Boeing to make good on
   all commitments to the time of delivery and all elements of
   guaranteed airplane performance that were specified in the half
   billion dollar contract. </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fortunately, Pratt had some power in reserve.
By strengthening the engine's compressor and turbine, it could
arrange for the engine to run at higher rotational speeds, processing
more airflow and yielding more thrust. This would boost takeoff power
to 43,500 pounds. Late in 1967, Pratt offered more. By providing
water injection, that firm would boost the takeoff thrust to 45,000
pounds. Pratt promised to deliver such engines late in 1969.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Water injection was a specialty of the house
at Pratt, dating to the piston-driven aircraft motors of World War
II. Small quantities of water injected into an engine's airflow would
evaporate within the engine, cooling the air and making it denser.
This denser air then could burn more fuel, for extra power. This same
principle had carried over to jet engines. Pratt had used water
injection on the engines of the Boeing 707. Its additional thrust
helped assure safe takeoffs. One senior Pan Am captain declared that
he would rather lose an engine on takeoff than lose his water
supply.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1967, however, Pratt, too, was
overextending itself. It was promising a hotter, heavier engine of
greater complexity: the plumbing and controls needed for water
injection would not be simple. Yet this firm was holding to the same
delivery schedule of a year and a half earlier, when the design of
the JT-9D had been so much less demanding. It was these engines that
would determine whether Boeing could build complete airplanes
[<A NAME="300"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">300</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] rather than gliders, and whether Pan Am and other
airlines could put the 747 into service. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">15</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In pursuing this program, Boeing faced
difficulties that went beyond the sheer size of the aircraft and the
need for its vast new Everett facility. The 747 set new marks in
complexity. For instance, it was so large that not one of its control
surfaces, such as ailerons or rudder, could be deflected through the
use of a pilot's muscles. The demands of safety then required four
independent hydraulic systems. Earlier jetliners, such as the 727,
had gotten along with only two. The demands on suppliers also were
correspondingly greater than on the earlier programs. In turn, the
task of assembling wings and tail surfaces was that much more
complex. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">16</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the outset, Boeing's senior management had
been well aware that the 747 would soak up money for several years
before it could begin to generate revenue by delivering complete
aircraft. The up-front expenses would include building and equipping
the Everett factory, paying wages and benefits for its workforce, and
assembling the first flyable 747 aircraft. Yet even then the company
would not be ready to deliver them to customers such as Pan Am. Those
initial production aircraft would first undergo extensive flight
tests that would win a federal Certificate of Airworthiness for the
747. During these tests, Boeing would have to continue paying
salaries as well as interest on borrowed money. This process of
certification represented a legal requirement that the 747 would have
to meet before it could see use in scheduled service. Only after
completion of this process would Boeing be free to deliver those
airliners and receive payment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hence, during 1966, the company laid financial
groundwork by assembling a billion-dollar kitty. It raised $420
million through sale of notes, convertible debentures, and stock.
Boeing's bankers helped as well, with a $400 million line of credit.
The firm owned a subsidiary that was building gas turbines; the
president, William Allen, ordered it sold. Airlines, placing orders
for the 747, also contributed. They had usually paid no more than
one-fourth of the purchase price prior to delivery. For the 747,
however, they would pay half. Pan Am, for one, would pay as much as
$275 million in advance. Then in 1967, company underwriters converted
recently-issued [<A NAME="301"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">301</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] debentures into new
stock, thus placing Boeing in a position to sell still more
securities. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As work began at Everett, however, the 747's
assemblers proved not necessarily to be the highly skilled production
workers upon whom Boeing had long relied. The mid-1960s had brought a
boom and had taken available aircraft assemblers for existing
programs, leaving relatively few for the 747. During 1967, amid the
buildup for this newest effort, Boeing hired 37,000 employees and let
25,000 go. The company was resting its prospects on its most
inexperienced workers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then the engine problems hit home. Coming to
the fore following the rollout of the first 747 in September 1968,
these problems dogged the program as it proceeded through initial
production and flight test. No one ever expected that the rollout
would lead in mere weeks to commercial service, for Boeing had
planned from the outset to use the entire year of 1969 in testing
five such aircraft. Still, in the words of John Newhouse of the New
Yorker:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">William Allen, now the honorary
   chairman, says that what he remembers best about the engines is
   that "they didn't work." Boeing used eighty-seven engines in
   testing the 747; sixty of them were destroyed in the process. At
   one time, Boeing had four 747s to be tested, and couldn't get more
   than one of them off the ground at a time, because so few of the
   engines were working. By 1969, finished 747s were rolling off the
   line, but there were no engines for them. Instead, Boeing was
   obliged to hang cement blocks on the wings so as to balance the
   airplanes and prevent them from tipping over.
   </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The flight tests disclosed a new engine
problem known as "ovalization," which cropped up only after hundreds
of hours in the air. It resulted from wear in the compressor
assemblies that distorted the circular cross sections of elements of
the compressor into an oval shape, with loss of power and
considerable increase in fuel consumption. This resulted from the
engines' high thrust, which reacted against their supports and bent
the engine casings. [<A NAME="302"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">302</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Though cure emerged
in the form of a steel yoke that would stiffen the case, it took time
to apply. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, new orders were drying up. During
1967, 1968, and 1969, the total value of airliners on order from
Boeing, of all types, fell from $3.2 billion to $1.1 billion. This
did not reflect a falloff in passenger demand, for airline traffic
was zooming. The carriers, however, had anticipated this demand and
had provided for it with their earlier purchases. Then, in 1970, as a
nationwide recession blew in, passenger traffic went flat. It would
not rise again until 1972. Airlines responded by cutting new orders
close to zero. Boeing's John Steiner notes that "at the bottom, we
did not sell a single commercial airplane to a U.S. trunk carrier for
a period of seventeen months."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 747 took its lumps as well. Airline
executives, sensing an opportunity, moved to sweeten their terms of
purchase. Instead of paying 50 percent of the purchase price prior to
delivery, they dropped the amount to 30 percent. It did not help; in
the year and a half after September 1970, Boeing sold only two 747s
in the world, and went nearly three years without a single sale to a
domestic carrier. Total orders were barely 200, too few to cover the
program's costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even when the Everett facility rolled out
production 747s, they were not always in condition for service. In
March 1970, two dozen of these craft were parked outside the factory
waiting for their engines. Together with other 747s in final
preparation, Everett had a total of $800 million worth of aircraft on
hand. Boeing could not receive the airlines' checks, for payments due
on delivery, until these planes were actually ready for commercial
use.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These cash-flow problems brought dreadful
consequences for the company's debt. Following conservative
accounting practices, Boeing had maintained the trust of its bankers.
This helped as the firm's debt, owed to a syndicate of banks, topped
the billion-dollar mark. In 1970, however, William Allen and Hal
Haynes, his chief financial officer, tried for a further increase in
their credit line and met defeat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To win further leeway, Boeing had few choices.
Its executives could not seek a merger, for the firm was heavily
burdened with debt; who would want to buy it? Nor could the company
raise capital by issuing new stock; its shares on Wall Street were in
a slump. Because it was indebted beyond the value of
[<A NAME="303"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">303</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] its net worth, there was no equity on which to base
an offering of new bonds or debentures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bankruptcy loomed. "We have never revealed how
close we got to the edge," wrote Steiner. In speaking of the 747,
William Allen noted that "the magnitude of the risk and the capital
required were sufficiently great that, at best, we knew that it would
strain the Boeing Company. It was really too large a project for us."
Though he had hoped to keep his debt below the billion-dollar mark,
the actual amount topped $2 billion. Much of the difference lay in
nearly-complete but undelivered aircraft that sat outside the Everett
plant, waiting for their engines. At the worst, Boeing's syndicated
debt, owed to its banks, reached $1.2 billion. This set a record, not
only within the aviation industry, but for all corporate borrowing.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The company could do little more than to fall
back on its own resources, instituting sweeping reorganizations aimed
at boosting efficiency. Massive layoffs paced these changes. The
Commercial Airplane Group was by far the largest part of Boeing, and
its employment peaked at 83,700 during 1968. Layoffs proceeded at a
modest pace during 1969 but stepped up abruptly during 1970. The
number of employees fell below 30,000 by year's end, dropping toward
a nadir of 20,750 late in 1971. This was part of an industrywide
trend, for from December 1970 to June 1972, employment in the
commercial airplane industry fell by nearly one-third.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During one week alone, some five thousand of
Boeing's people received pink slips. Firings reached to the top of
major organizations; even vice-presidents got the axe. People took to
saying that an optimist was someone who brought a lunch to work; a
pessimist kept his auto engine running while he went inside.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the Seattle area, the consequences were
devastating. Each unemployed Boeing worker cost the job of at least
one other person, due to the loss of the worker's purchases and
spending. The resulting multiplier effect sent unemployment to 14
percent, the highest in the nation, according to the Department of
Labor. About the same number of people were on welfare or receiving
food stamps. Enrollment in a free-lunch program for schoolchildren
soared more than fiftyfold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="304"></A></FONT><B><FONT

went on sale at half price-and drew no takers. A former Boeing
employee had to back out of a deal to buy a house with a federal
low-interest loan, for nothing down. Apartment managers offered a
month's free rent along with a free stereo. Nevertheless, vacancy
rates reached 40 percent in some suburbs and topped 16 percent within
the area, up from one percent during the boom of 1967. Night after
night, near the main airport, fewer than half the available motel
rooms were full. The operator of one motel, the Sky Harbor, declared
that he would "rent any room for any price right now."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Auto sales dropped by as much as 50 percent,
and more than a dozen dealerships went under. Seattle's sister city,
Kobe in Japan, sent food parcels and relief funds. As people fled the
area in droves, the demand for U-Haul trailers grew so large that
local agencies ran out of equipment to lease. Two real-estate men put
up a billboard near the airport, showing a light bulb hanging on a

own day of decision. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Supersonic Transport
(SST)</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The SST took shape as a response to a joint
Anglo-French venture, the Concorde. Like the 747, the push for
supersonic commercial flight demanded heavy dollops of advanced
technology. While the 747 developed into an exercise in corporate
management and finance, the Concorde and SST programs were marked by
politics. The politics featured international agreements, competing
centers of influence in Washington, congressional hearings, and the
rise of environmentalism as a major popular movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Concorde grew out of a strong base of
experience, in both Great Britain and France, in commercial aviation
as well as supersonic flight. [<A NAME="305"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">305</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Britain's Sir Frank
Whittle had invented the jet engine; the Yankees had for a time been
little more than apt pupils of the British, with General Electric
building British-designed engines under license. Sir Geoffrey de
Havilland, a leading planebuilder, then had parlayed this engine
technology into the Comet, the world's first commercial jetliner.
Though it aimed at the transatlantic market, it proved uneconomical
and failed to compete with the 707 and DC-8. It did, however,
demonstrate a clear penchant for pioneering.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The French followed with the Caravelle, a
small short-range jetliner built by Sud Aviation in Toulouse.
Significantly, its engines also were British: Avon turbojets from
Rolls Royce, with 12,600 pounds of thrust. In this fashion, the
Caravelle set a precedent for future Anglo-French cooperation. It
sold well in Europe, and won sales in America as well. United
Airlines bought 20 of them, putting the first ones in service in
mid-1961. For France, this was a breakthrough; never before had a
French manufacturer sold aircraft to a U.S. airline.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another French planebuilder, Marcel Dassault,
spent the 1950s leading his country into supersonic flight. The
company he headed, Avions Dassault, built the Mystere IV-B, the first
European plane to break the sound barrier in level flight. It
accomplished this feat in February 1954, only nine months after an
American fighter, the F-100, did the same. Then, in October 1958,
another Dassault aircraft, a Mirage III-A, became the first European
aircraft to fly at Mach 2.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The British were also making sonic booms. The
firm of Fairey built an experimental jet, the Delta FD-2. In March
1956, it set a world speed record at Mach 1.71, or 1132 mph. Another
company, Bristol Siddeley, developed a highly capable engine called
the Olympus; an upgraded version would power the Concorde. In
addition, the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough was a
world-class center of aeronautical research. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two planebuilding firms, Sud Aviation and
British Aircraft, carried through the design studies that led to the
Concorde. For the engine, Bristol Siddeley cooperated with SNECMA, a
French firm that had built engines for the Mirage fighters of
Dassault. As design concepts took shape, leaders in both countries
cherished the hope that they might leap past the era of subsonic
[<A NAME="306"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">306</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] jets, in which America had taken a strong lead, and
take the initiative in a new realm of supersonic flight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">France, led by the strongly nationalistic
Charles de Gaulle, had reasons of its own to proceed. De Gaulle had
vowed to challenge what he called "America's colonization of the
skies," and won strong support from his nation. There was widespread
resentment of American corporations that were dominating a host of
European markets, including commercial aviation. This resentment was
quite similar to what Americans themselves would feel, two decades
later, as Japan took over increasing shares of the automobile and
electronics industries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The joint commitment to Concorde took the form
of an intergovernmental agreement in November 1962, with the force of
a treaty. Each nation agreed to carry half the cost. In turn, the
four participating companies-Sud, British Aircraft, Bristol Siddeley,
SNECMA-would all work as contractors to their respective governments.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This challenge was too serious for President
Kennedy to ignore. America's planebuilders had nothing like Concorde
in the offing. Moreover, there was never any prospect that an
American SST would go forward as a purely commercial venture, with
corporations raising the needed funds through bank loans and sales of
securities. The costs of an SST would be too great, as were the
technical uncertainties. In addition to this, airline executives,
busily purchasing the current generation of jets, were far from
thrilled at the thought of being stampeded into a supersonic era.
Within the Kennedy Administration, however, the SST found a
persuasive champion in Najeeb Halaby, the head of the Federal
Aviation Agency.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">25</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Halaby started in early 1961 by winning a
congressional appropriation of $11 million with which he launched
feasibility studies. Late in 1962, with the study results in hand and
the Concorde under way, he urged JFK to initiate a major SST program
in response. Though Kennedy was not quite ready just then, he
responded by commissioning an interagency review headed by Vice
President Lyndon Johnson (LBJ), a strong SST supporter. While this
review proceeded, Juan Trippe proceeded to stir the pot.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="307"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">307</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] During the spring
of 1963, Trippe let it be known that he intended to place a
"protective order" for six Concordes. He, however, would much prefer
to purchase American SSTs, should they become available. In June, he
announced that he was taking options on the European airliner,
putting down money to reserve positions on the production schedule,
though he was not actually committing to make the purchases. By then,
Kennedy had the favorable results of the interagency review. On the
day after Trippe's announcement, he also made a favorable statement
of his own. Addressing the graduating cadets of the Air Force
Academy, he declared:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is my judgement that this Government
   should immediately commence a new program in partnership with
   private industry to develop at the earliest practical date the
   prototype of a commercially successful supersonic transport,
   superior to that being built in any other country in the
   world.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">26</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In his formal message to Congress, sent in
mid-June, he emphasized that the government would put up no more than
$750 million, while the manufacturers would carry at least 25 percent
of the development costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Halaby got the program off to a running start
in August, as the FAA issued a formal Request for Proposal to
interested companies. As they prepared their proposals, however,
executives of major planebuilders also came forward with complaints.
They objected strongly to the cost-sharing arrangements, under which
they were to put up 25 percent of the program expense. This was their
way of declaring that the SST looked like a fine way to lose money.
Nevertheless, they would do their duty as patriots if Uncle Sam would
carry more of the financial load. Boeing's William Allen was
particularly blunt: "Government must be prepared to render greater
financial assistance than presently proposed."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Kennedy responded by commissioning an outside
review of the issue, putting it in the hands of Eugene Black, former
president of the World Bank, and Stanley Osborne, chairman of Olin
Mathieson. He asked them not only to review the cost-sharing issue
but also to cast a broad net by talking as well to government
officials. Their report reached the White House a week before
Christmas, with Lyndon B. Johnson now holding the presidency
following the death of Kennedy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="308"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">308</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The report's
conclusions were devastating to Halaby. It rejected his view that the
SST should go forward as a race with Concorde. Instead, the effort
was to focus initially on building a test aircraft to serve for
research. The report went so far as to recommend that the program
should be taken out of Halaby's hands altogether, for the FAA had no
staff ready to manage such a task. On the cost-sharing issue, it
recommended that the government should pick up 90 as opposed to 75
percent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These conclusions generally suited the
preferences of another player: Robert McNamara. He had faced down the
Air Force in dealing with a technically similar program, the North
American B-70, that sought to build supersonic bombers with the size
and speed of an SST. Though Air Force generals had called for its
rapid development and production, McNamara endorsed an Eisenhower
Administration decision to build only three prototype craft, XB-70s,
for use in flight test. McNamara also had developed an interest in
the SST itself, and had served as a member of Vice-President
Johnson's interagency review panel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Black-Osborne report set in motion a
Washington debate that eased Halaby toward the margins of SST
management and made McNamara a central figure. In April 1964, Lyndon
B Johnson picked him to head a presidential advisory committee on the
SST. Though the program remained within the FAA, high-level decisions
went into the hands of this advisory panel. As defense secretary,
McNamara had insisted that new military programs were to receive
extensive study and analysis before their managers could cut metal
for prototypes. He now approached the SST from the same perspective,
arguing that the FAA should commit to building a prototype only after
suitably refined designs were in hand and only after serious economic
analyses showed a reasonable prospect for success.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">27</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It would take nearly three years, till the end
of 1966, before SST studies would reach this level of depth. An
initial issue for research involved public response to sonic booms.
These are different from ordinary loud noises, as from a jackhammer.
A sonic boom arises from an airplane's shock wave, which spreads
behind the aircraft like the bow wave of a ship. The shock produces a
moving wall of compressed air that trails along the ground, sweeping
[<A NAME="309"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">309</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] out a swath up to 50 miles wide and the full length
of the supersonic flightpath. Within this swath, every person feels
the boom when the shock passes. The pressure rise is not large,
rarely more than a thousandth of atmospheric pressure. It is,
however, both sharp and sudden; hence it can startle people and crack
plaster. The strength of a sonic boom is measured as an overpressure;
designers expected that an SST would produce values of around two
pounds per square foot during cruise. By contrast, loud noises have
their intensity measured in decibels, a completely different unit.
Hence the FAA wanted to know how boomy an SST could be and still
produce no more annoyance than conventional subsonic jets.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An initial exercise, Operation Bongo, took
place around Oklahoma City during 1964. It was a joint FAA-Air Force
experiment that sought to determine whether people could learn to
accept sonic booms as just another type of noise, akin to that of
railroad trains or trucks on a highway. For six months the Air Force
sent supersonic F-104 fighters over the city, day after day and at
specified times. Observers found reason to believe that there might
indeed not be much of a problem, for a number of people put the booms
to their advantage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A secretary used the recurring booms as an
alarm clock. She got out of bed at the window-rattling crack of the
seven a.m. boom, then took a shower. She shut off the water when she
heard the next boom, for this meant it was 7:20, time to start her
day. Other people also treated the eight daily booms as if they were
blasts from a factory whistle. One group of construction workers used
the eleven a.m. boom as their signal for a coffee break. Animals as
well went undisturbed. In El Reno, a nearby town, a farmer saw a tom
turkey chasing a hen. Though a boom rattled the barn, the tom never
broke stride.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In several respects, these tests were biased
toward minimizing citizen complaints. Oklahoma City was strongly
aviation-minded, with a major FAA center and an Air Force base. The
booms came by day, never at night, and people knew when to expect
them. They also knew that the test would run for only a few months.
The booms themselves were weaker than those of an SST and carried
less energy, though they did increase in strength over the
months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, the results were enough to give
pause, as some 4900 people filed claims for damages. Though most
involved little more than cracked plaster, one man did receive a
payment of $10,000. Two high-rise office towers sustained a total of
147 cracked windows. During the first three months of the
[<A NAME="310"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">310</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] tests, polls indicated that 90 percent of the people
felt they could live with the booms. After six months, this number
was down to 73 percent. This meant that some one-fourth of these
citizens believed they could not live with them and would regard them
as unacceptable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This was bad news at the FAA in Washington.
The news soon grew worse, as a second series of tests, at Edwards Air
Force Base, introduced the use of larger supersonic aircraft. These
included the XB-70, the only plane in the world with the size and
speed of an SST. The workhorse of the new studies, the B-58 bomber,
was only slightly smaller. Already it had shown its uses in
sonic-boom tests, flying from Los Angeles to New York in two hours.
Unfortunately, it had shattered windows as well as speed records,
showering offices and living rooms alike with broken glass. Police
switchboards from coast to coast had lit up with calls as frightened
people reported they had heard a terrible explosion.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">28</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The tests at Edwards took place during 1966,
and Karl Kryter, a sonic-boom specialist at Stanford Research
Institute, summarized the findings in the journal </FONT><I><FONT

European and American SSTs were fully operational, late in the 1970s,
</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">it is expected that about 65 million
   people in the United States could be exposed to an average of
   about ten sonic booms per day.... A boom will initially be
   equivalent in acceptability to the noise from a present-day
   four-engined turbofan jet at an altitude of about 200 feet during
   approach to landing, or at 500 feet with takeoff power, or the
   noise from a truck at maximum highway speed at a distance of about
   30 feet.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian Mel Horwitch would note that
when these results reached an SST coordinating committee, "an almost
instant consensus developed that the American SST could never fly
overland."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This did not rule out going ahead with the
program. Boeing and the FAA estimated that even if the SST was
restricted to overwater flights, it could still sell 500 airplanes.
That would suffice to ensure commercial success. With no
restrictions, Boeing's managers believed they could sell as many as
twelve hundred. Business Week noted that "at $40 million per SST,
[<A NAME="311"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">311</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] a ban would mean a sales penalty of $28
billion-greater than Boeing's total sales for the last fifteen
years."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Similar warnings came from Senator William
Proxmire, an eventual opponent of the Space Shuttle who was already
taking the lead as a strong opponent of the SST: "The SST will start
by flying the ocean routes. Soon the economic pressures of flying
these high-cost planes on limited routes will force admission of the
planes to a few scattered land routes. And ultimately they will be
flying everywhere." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Also during 1966, design studies and analyses
reached a level that allowed the FAA to select contractors through a
design competition. Boeing won, with a proposal that called for
engines from General Electric. This contract award came through on
the last day of that year; a four-year program now lay ahead, aimed
at building two prototype aircraft. This selection of contractors was
crucial. The program now was in a new phase, no longer one of endless
study but rather of mainstream airliner development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This shift in status brought a quick response
from SST critics, as the beginnings of organized opposition took
form. The man who did the organizing was William Shurcliff, a physics
professor at Harvard. Early in 1967, he set up the Citizens League
Against the Sonic Boom. His son and sister were founding members; its
office was in his home. He did not set out to arrange protest
demonstrations. Instead, he proceeded to run a clearinghouse for
critics, taking out newspaper ads, writing letters, raising
questions, and generally working to argue that the emperor had no
clothes. His organization was never large, its peak membership
running to only a few thousand. The rudder of a ship is also quite
small. Like that rudder, Shurcliff would prove to be highly
influential in steering the SST to its fate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Shurcliff's activities unfolded within a
burgeoning environmental movement that was about to rise to a height
of influence. This movement drew strength from a surge in public
outrage against air and water pollution. As early as 1965, the
Opinion Research Corp., a polling organization, found that up to
one-third of the American people viewed such issues as serious. Here
was a level of concern that no political leader could ignore. By
1970, nearly three-fourths of the public shared this attitude,
representing a power capable of sweeping everything before it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="312"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">312</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Matching this rise
was a dramatic increase in the prominence and clout of leading
environmental organizations. In 1967, the Sierra Club, then with only
55,000 members, was already one of the largest and most active of
these groups. Though its emphasis was on protecting wilderness areas,
its focus at the time was on a regional issue, fighting the
construction of Marble Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. To win
political support, it had to bend to the needs of such powerful
senators as Henry Jackson, chairman of the Senate Interior Committee
and a strong SST supporter. By 1971, its membership was at 200,000
and rising, and its leaders were taking pivotal roles in the fight
against the SST.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The rapid growth in environmental concern
during the late 1960s recalls the widening power of the civil rights
movement. A turning point for that movement had come in Birmingham,
Alabama in May 1963, when the nation watched as that city's
commissioner turned police dogs and fire hoses against protesting
black citizens. For the nation's environmentalists, a similar moment
came early in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Santa Barbara Channel is rich in offshore
oil; a line of drilling platforms stands six miles out to sea. Early
that February, an oil-well blowout sent vast flows of crude into the
water, where it quickly drifted onto the beaches. The Santa Barbara
beaches, as highly prized as those of Malibu, now turned from shining
white to gummy black. The very waves of the ocean lay unformed as
they drowned beneath the thick suffocating scum. Its stink blew into
the canyons, a mile and more inland. It took live steam to remove
this ugly mess from the hulls of boats, and the toll of birds and sea
life was immense. The historian William Manchester would write that
"pelicans drove straight into the oil and then sank, unable to raise
their matted wings, and the beaches were studded with dead
sandpipers, cormorants, gulls, grebes, and loons, their eyes horribly
swollen and their viscera burned by petroleum." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Shurcliff had been proceeding with his
anti-SST activism. In July 1969, he received valuable support as
David Brower, who had been executive director of the Sierra Club,
founded Friends of the Earth. It took a strong stand against the SST.
The following March, a wealthy Baltimore man, Kenneth Greif, took the
lead in organizing a nationwide coalition of SST opponents.
[<A NAME="313"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">313</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] The Sierra Club now signed on. So did the National
Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness Society, and the Consumer
Federation of America. In this coalition, opponents now had an
instrument suited for work in the political arena.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A nucleus of anti-SST sentiment already lay at
hand within the Senate, where William Proxmire regarded its economics
as most curious. The plan called for the FAA to put up $1.3 billion
to carry the program through the construction and test of two
prototypes. The SST then would go into production, and Boeing would
pay the government a royalty on each plane sold. The federal outlay
thus was "not a subsidy, it's a loan," said William Magruder, a
Lockheed man who had taken over as SST program manager. "By the time
the 300th airplane is sold, all of the Government's investment will
be returned to the U.S. Treasury, and when we sell five hundred
airplanes, there will be a billion dollars in profit to the
Government."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Proxmire responded by arguing that Uncle Sam
was not a venture capitalist. If this "loan" was so profitable, then
Boeing should tap into its banks instead, as it had done in financing
the 747. Referring to Nixon's SST budget request for fiscal 1971,
Proxmire added, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The immediate focus of attention was a
congressional hearing held in May 1970, with Proxmire as chairman. He
chose the witnesses with care. Among
[<A NAME="314"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">314</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] them was Richard Garwin, a senior physicist at IBM
who had participated in a White House review of the program. Calling
for an immediate end to its federal support, Garwin asserted that
"the SST will produce as much noise as the simultaneous takeoff of
fifty jumbo jets." He drew concurrence from Russell Train, a member
of Nixon's Council on Environmental Quality, who described such noise
as the SST's "most significant unresolved environmental
problem."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Train also opened a new attack by introducing
the issue of whether a fleet of SSTs might damage the ozone layer in
the upper atmosphere. The air at its cruising altitude, some 65,000
feet, is very dry and low in humidity. It also is rich in ozone,
which forms a layer that protects the earth from the sun's dangerous
ultraviolet rays. The atmospheric scientist Conway Leovy, writing in
the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Journal of Geophysical
Research</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, had set forth a "wet
photolysis" theory whereby water vapor in the stratosphere could
speed the destruction of ozone.</FONT></P>

would discharge "large quantities of water vapor, carbon dioxide,
nitrogen oxides and particulate matter." He added that "500 American
SSTs and Concordes flying in this region of the atmosphere could,
over a period of years, increase the water content by as much as 50
to 100 percent." This water vapor, formed copiously from the burning
of jet fuel, could destroy some of the ozone, putting the world at
greater risk from the ultraviolet. Proxmire welcomed Train's
statement as a "blockbuster."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The turn of the tide quickly became evident.
During the previous autumn, SST funding had passed by large margins
in both the House and Senate. On May 27, however, voting on the 1971
budget, the House passed the bill by only 13 votes, 176 to 163.
Opponents took new heart, for they understood that with the margin of
victory having narrowed so dramatically, the SST might quickly fall
during the next round of congressional action.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the summer of 1970, critics sprouted
anew. In July, the Airport Operators Council, representing all major
airports, stated that the SST should receive funding only if it could
meet stringent noise standards. In August, a group at MIT, conducting
the Study of Critical Environmental Problems, gave further support to
concerns about the upper atmosphere. It stated that a fleet of SSTs
could produce effects similar to those of the 1963 eruption of the
volcano Mt. Agung, which had increased stratospheric temperatures by
as much as 12 degrees. In September, the prestigious Federation of
American Scientists came out against the SST. So did the mayor of New
York, John Lindsay, who was widely viewed as the Republicans' answer
to the Kennedys.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="315"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">315</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Also in September,
Kenneth Greif's coalition orchestrated a devastating attack on the
SST's economic prospects. Over a dozen prominent economists signed
individual statements stating their criticisms. The group included
Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, John Kenneth
Galbraith, Wassily Leontief, Walter Heller, and Arthur Okun, who had
chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisors. The group
thus spanned the political spectrum from Friedman on the right to
Galbraith on the left. Only one leading economist, Henry Wallich,
came out in favor of the SST.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Senate leaders put off their vote until after
the November election, a move that SST supporters hoped would allow
some senators to vote with less fear of public pressure. Instead, the
delay gave opponents more time to organize. Leading supporters
included the senators from Washington state, Warren Magnuson and
Henry Jackson. On November 30, sensing defeat, they introduced a
last-minute bill to ban overland flights that would produce sonic
booms. It was too late; such bills had been in the congressional
hopper since 1963, and the fact that this one passed unanimously was
not important. After all, it would have to pass the House as well,
where it quickly died. Early in December, the Senate voted to kill
funding for the SST, 52 to 41.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This was not the end of the matter. The House,
after all, had passed the bill in May, albeit narrowly. Now a
conference committee recommended a compromise: to continue the SST
program, but with reduced funding. The issue was not settled; it now
would take the form of whether Congress would accept or reject this
new arrangement. The vote would not take place for three
months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Again, though, time worked for the opponents.
In January 1971, the citizens' group Common Cause, which was growing
in influence, announced its opposition. So did Charles Lindbergh, the
man who had flown to Paris in 1927. Still active after all those
years, he had long held a seat on Pan Am's board of directors, and
had become an ardent environmentalist. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another round of hearings would precede the
votes, and again the opponents had new ammunition. James McDonald of
the University of Arizona, a member of a National Academy of Sciences
panel on climate modification, asserted that 500 SSTs could deplete
enough ozone to produce 10,000 cases.... </FONT></P>

threat to ozone from water vapor. Ironically, this wet-photolysis
theory was overturned within months, as new research in atmospheric
science showed that the effects of water vapor on ozone were all but
nil. Another scientist, Harold Johnston of the University of
California at Berkeley, rode to the rescue by asserting that nitrogen
oxides would also damage the ozone layer. SST engines would produce
such oxides in large quantities. Johnston calculated that 500 SSTs
would destroy up to half the ozone in the air over the United States.

FACE="Geneva">317</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Not all the
arguments were on Proxmire's side. During 1970, the pro-SST forces
had consisted largely of the usual corporate interests. By early
1971, however, these forces were stiffening their strength. A key
argument involved jobs: With the Concorde as an SST in being, an
American riposte was essential. That argument had failed to win more
than divided support among union leaders, but now George Meany, head
of organized labor's powerful AFL-CIO federation, came out in favor
of the SST. Nixon Administration officials also weighed in with
endorsements. Even William Ruckelshaus, director of the new
Environmental Protection Agency, argued in favor of building at least
the two prototypes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Acoustics expert Leo Beranek, chief scientist
of the firm of Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, concluded that production
SSTs could be quiet enough to meet FAA noise restrictions. There also
was countering testimony on the atmosphere, as William Kellogg,
associate director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
stated that effects due to SSTs would be imperceptible amid those due
to natural causes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Yet, by 1971, the issue was well past being
one of whether design refinements might address specific objections
or whether new research might lay scientists' concerns to rest. The
public was simply against the SST, by over 85 percent in opinion
polls. In 1971, barely half of all Americans had ever flown in any
kind of airplane; supersonic flight to Europe was as far beyond most
expectations as a visit to Shangri-La. </FONT><I><FONT

as December 1970, the House had maintained its narrow margin of
support. Now, however, Congressman Sidney Yates, a key SST opponent,
took the floor and said, "I demand tellers with clerks." This set in
motion a new procedure, in use only since the beginning of the year,
whereby the votes would be recorded. Unable to vote in secrecy, as it
had done before, the House turned thumbs down on the SST, 215 to 204.
The Senate repeated its earlier no vote, and it was all over.

eliminated further federal funding for the SST. They did not ban the
construction of SSTs using private-sector funding; Boeing was
perfectly free to proceed with the program, if it could win the
necessary support through banks or sale of securities. The company,
however, was already mortgaged to the hilt; its financial leeway was
close to zero. When the SST died on Capitol Hill, it died for
good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This congressional action had important
consequences. It marked an end to the policy of having the FAA take
on a new role by underwriting the development of new jetliners. The
funding of such projects now returned to the private sector. The FAA
returned to its permanent responsibilities, which included air
traffic control and certification of airliners and their
equipment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The demise of the SST also brought an end to a
half-century of continuing advance in the performance of commercial
airliners. The industry would continue to come forth with new
designs, but these would be conventional in form. The nation's
airlines would find their future below the speed of sound and at
altitudes well under the ozone layer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the struggle over the SST, the
environmental movement came of age and took its place as a major and
powerful political force. In defeating the SST, the nation's
environmentalists showed that they had the clout to block such a
program even when it held support from the AFL-CIO, the
Administration, and the aerospace industry with its well-funded
lobby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With its votes against the SST, the House and
Senate showed that they would cancel an important aerospace program
even in the face of an industry-wide recession, and with the national
economy as a whole in a slump. This raised the question of whether
Congress as a whole would continue to oppose the interests of this
industry. This question would not take long in receiving an answer,
for in the immediate wake of the SST controversy, Congress faced a
debate over another project: the Lockheed L-1011 airliner.</FONT>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Lockheed L-1011</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new high-bypass turbofan engines, which
launched the Boeing 747, also launched a parallel effort that proved
less ambitious but better-suited to the workaday needs of the
nation's domestic carriers. At American Airlines, the vice-president
of engineering, Frank Kolk, was responsible for determining what type
of equipment his airline would need and for working with the
manufacturers [<A NAME="319"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">319</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] to get it. When
Juan Trippe ordered his 747s, in April 1966, Kolk saw that this
aircraft was far too large for his market. He quickly took the
initiative in recommending the development of another new airliner,
one that would offer wide-body comfort along with the economy of the
new turbofans. His plane, however, would be intermediate in size
between the earlier jets and the 747.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Kolk's initial concept was well suited to
American's route structure, which featured large numbers of flights
between New York and Chicago. Indeed, it was a little too well
suited; it lacked the size and performance that other airlines
demanded. Kolk held discussions with his counterparts at Eastern,
TWA, United, and Delta, and together they agreed that the new
airliner was to have three engines and a larger passenger capacity.
These four carriers along with American would be the initial
customers, and Kolk and his colleagues proceeded to develop a common
set of requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two planebuilders, Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas, proceeded to craft designs. This, however, was no federal
competition for a contract, wherein one would win and the other would
lose; this was an exercise in free-market competition, in which both
firms had the opportunity to vie for success. The designs that
emerged, the DC-10 and L-1011, were highly similar in size,
performance, and general appearance, reflecting their compliance with
Kolk's specifications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During 1966, Lockheed was matched with Boeing
in a federal competition that was the mirror image of the one in
1965. That earlier bidding war had involved the C-5A; when Boeing
lost, its management immediately moved to pursue the 747. In 1966,
the focus of attention was the SST, with these same firms competing
for the FAA contract, and this time it was Boeing's turn to win.
Lockheed's president, Daniel Haughton, learned the news on the last
day of the year. Like his counterparts at Boeing, he immediately
ordered that the people who were working on the SST shift gears and
turn their attention to Kolk's airliner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In aerospace design, small details can have
large consequences, and this would be true of the L-1011. This
airliner was to install one of its engines at the rear end of the
fuselage, receiving its air through a curving duct that ran beneath
the vertical fin. At the outset, Lockheed's engineers knew that they
needed a short engine to fit this installation. Neither General
Electric nor Pratt &amp; Whitney had what they wanted, but a third
player was at hand: Britain's Rolls-Royce. That company had a design
on paper for a new engine, the.... </FONT></P>

of its Aero Engine Department, David Huddie. Above all, he wanted to
place his company's engines within America's new generation of
wide-body jetliners. Rolls had never cracked the domestic market in
America, the world's most lucrative, but Huddie saw his opportunity
in the L-1011. He succeeded, and in return he later received
knighthood from the Queen. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">35</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By 1971, however, Lockheed's Dan Haughton was
finding that he had hatched some chickens that now were coming home
to roost. This had happened during 1965, when he had presided over
his company's bid for the C-5A. The company had needed the work quite
badly; if it had lost the contract, it would have had to shut down a
division in Georgia, a major operating arm. To guard against this,
Haughton had "bought in," submitting an unrealistically low bid of
$1.95 billion. Even the Air Force had estimated that $2.2 billion
would be more like it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then, amid escalation of both inflation and
the Vietnam War, the C-5A program encountered major strains and
delays. Costs went through the roof.
[<A NAME="321"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">321</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] By 1971, the Pentagon had budgeted $1.3 billion to
cover Lockheed's share of the overrun. Though most of this would be
charged to the taxpayers, Lockheed would take its lumps as well.
Early in 1971, Haughton, now chairman, agreed to accept an additional
loss of $200 million. That wiped out a modest profit; it even cut
into the company's net worth. This news would not be welcome at the
annual meeting, but business was business, and this transaction meant
that Lockheed could begin to put the messiness of the C-5A behind it.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">36</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Haughton executed the agreement, headed for
the airport, and flew to London to talk about the L-1011 with people
from Rolls-Royce. As he later put it, "For about fourteen hours I
felt good." Rolls had been buying in as well, and for the same
reason: it needed the business. Its 1968 contract with Lockheed had
committed Rolls to develop its turbofan, the RB-211, for a fixed
price of $156 million and Lockheed to pay $840,000 for each engine.
Rolls was also pushing onto new ground. This became apparent as the
development of the RB-211 proceeded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rolls had been pioneering in the use of carbon
fiber, a strong and very lightweight material. In selling the RB-211,
a key point had been the firm's intention to build its fan of Hyfil,
a proprietary carbon-reinforced epoxy. Hyfil resembles plastics used
in today's tennis rackets, and its use in the three engines of an
L-1011 stood to save 900 pounds of weight. Such fans must stand up to
collisions with seagulls in flight. Hyfil's merits would rest on its
ability to pass the chicken test. This involved a cannon that would
fire four-pound chicken carcasses at an engine operating at full
speed on a test stand. The blades broke under the impact, which meant
that these blades would have to use the conventional material,
titanium. Titanium was heavier than Hyfil, and this change marked a
sharp setback for the RB-211 program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was one of a number of problems that drove
up the program's cost. As this cost escalated, Rolls reported a loss
of $115 million for the first half of 1970. Its chairman, Sir Denning
Pearson, turned to the recently-elected Tory government of Prime
Minister Edward Heath. The Tories responded by offering a subsidy of
$100 million. Pearson, however, had failed to control his costs and
hence he would have to go; the firm would have a new chairman, Lord
Cole. His board members would include a representative of the
government, [<A NAME="322"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">322</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Ian Morrow, who
specialized in healing sick companies. Morrow soon arranged for an
independent accounting firm, Cooper Brothers, to audit Rolls'
books.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was ample opportunity for questions, for
Pearson had been using accounting practices that made bankers wince.
Since 1961, he had avoided debiting the expenses of jet-engine
development in the years they were incurred. Rather, he held them
over and debited them in subsequent years, as these engines reached
their customers. This practice amounted to prorating the development
cost against income from sales. In this fashion, Rolls had reported a
string of profits prior to 1970. Now it was difficult to know the
firm's total liabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Cooper audit even had difficulty in
estimating the cost of completing the development of the RB-211. The
1968 contract had specified $156 million. Early in 1971, it was at
least $408 million. In turn, Lockheed had contracted to pay $840,000
for each engine, a price that supposedly would allow Rolls to make a
profit. However, the bare-bones cost of production, even without
profit, would now be $1.1 million. In addition to this, Rolls would
deliver the engines late. As a consequence, it faced penalties for
late delivery of an additional $120 million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">All this meant that Rolls was well past the
point where an extra $100 million from the government, or even $200
million, could make a difference. Late in January 1971, Lord Cole
learned that he lacked the funds to proceed with the RB-211. His
board of directors promptly voted to place the entire company in
receivership. In a word, Rolls was bankrupt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This would be very bad news for Haughton.
Britain's bankruptcy laws are far more stringent than those in the
United States. American law works to protect a company against its
creditors, shielding the firm against debts and legal claims while
seeking a reorganization that can open a path to profitability. In
Britain, however, creditors come first. A company is not permitted to
operate if it has no prospect of success. Rather, it must sell off
its assets and go out of business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the Rolls-Royce board reached this
decision on January 26, it did not announce it publicly. A week later
Haughton, newly arrived at the Hilton Hotel, received a phone call
from Lord Cole of Rolls: Could they meet privately at the Grosvenor
House? Cole proceeded to tell him the news, which was both unexpected
and crushing. When other executives arrived, for a
[<A NAME="323"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">323</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] previously scheduled luncheon, they found Haughton
looking "as if he had got a bullet between the eyes."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The bullet was aimed more at Lockheed than at
its chairman, for those engine intakes on the L-1011 now were all too
likely to suck the company into its own bankruptcy. There simply was
no easy alternative to the Rolls engines. To turn to Pratt &amp;
Whitney for its JT-9D turbofan or to General Electric for its own
commercial engine, the CF-6, would cost a year in time and $100
million in development costs. That was because neither of these
engines would slip in neatly as a replacement. There would be need
for extensive redesign of engine housings and installations, starting
with wind-tunnel tests, proceeding through reconsideration of weight
distributions, and ending with extensive new tests necessary to win
FAA certification. Lockheed would receive a triple blow: a massive
overrun, a set of prices charged to airlines that would bring further
losses on each sale, and penalties payable to the airlines for late
delivery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, Lockheed already was deep
in hock, having drawn $350 million from a $400-million credit line
held by a syndicate of its banks. It could not seek help from the
Defense Department; the settlement of the C-5A had also settled other
outstanding issues. The company's stock was depressed. Worse, the
L-1011 itself was stirring little interest. Though it had pulled in
as many as 168 orders back in 1968, the total since then had grown by
only ten more. Lockheed had not booked a single order for it in over
a year. Yet to abandon the L-1011 was unthinkable. Its overhang of
bank debt could drive Lockheed into insolvency as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rolls' receiver, Rupert Nicholson of Peat,
Marwick, and Mitchell, took control of that company on February 4. On
the same day, the bankruptcy was announced in the House of Commons.
As one official told the magazine Fortune, "The news was like hearing
that Westminster Abbey had become a brothel." Prime Minister Heath
might have bailed everyone out by nationalizing the whole of Rolls,
but he had excellent reason not to do so. His legal advisers held
that by doing so, the government could become liable for Rolls's
debts, the magnitude of which was unknown even to the auditors from
Cooper Brothers. Instead, Heath would take over only the portions of
the company that were building military equipment. The receiver could
sell off the division that was building the famous motorcars, which
was profitable and would readily find a buyer. As for the RB-211,
Heath would leave it to twist slowly in the wind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="324"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">324</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] This approach drew
vigorous objection in Parliament. Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the
Liberal Party, stated that the L-1011 would then be "the largest
glider in the world." Worse, a default on Rolls's contract with
Lockheed would "throw into doubt our credibility, our commercial
competence and our good faith in all spheres of advanced science."
Labour M.P.'s raised the issue of jobs for the some 24,000 people who
were working on the RB-211 at Rolls and at its subcontractors and
suppliers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Faced with such arguments, Heath unbent
slightly, agreeing to have his defense minister take a closer look at
the engine's prospects. This minister, Lord Carrington, appointed
three investigators that he called his "ferrets," whose report a few
weeks later struck a more hopeful note. The RB-211 was meeting its
performance goals in runs on the test stand. This was important; it
meant the engine after all could be a technical success. Moreover,
its development could go to completion for an extra $288
million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even so, the odds were formidable against
saving the RB-211, and hence Lockheed. Twenty-four banks were
directly involved as Haughton's creditors. All were highly averse to
risk. Nevertheless, they would have to live with it and accept more;
they might even have to throw good money after bad. Nine customers
also had ordered the L-1011. Each had its own financial problems and
could solve them in part by enforcing contract provisions requiring
Lockheed to pay out money as a penalty for late delivery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though his hand was weak, Haughton was not
without cards of his own to play. The banks, after all, wanted him to
succeed; a Lockheed bankruptcy would leave them with bad debts,
whereas with forbearance they might yet continue to hold profitable
loans. The customers also had reason to stick with the L-1011, for
they had already laid out substantial down payments. They also had
purchased this airliner on highly favorable terms. This had resulted
from Lockheed's competition with the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, wherein
Lockheed had won orders by lowering its price and sweetening the
terms of sale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even under the best of circumstances, the
problems with the program would bring delays of several months in
delivering the L-1011. However, most major airlines had lost money in
1970. They were in no hurry to receive the new airliners in
accordance with the contracted schedule. To the contrary, delays in
delivery would also put off the dates when they would have to pay the
balance of the purchase price. The chairman of TWA went so far as to
suggest that "a delay of a year would have as many advantages as
disadvantages, maybe more."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="325"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">325</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Hence, the report
to Lord Carrington meant that the outlines of a deal could begin to
emerge. In essence, it would call on everyone to go back to Square
One and renegotiate their contracts, paying little heed to the legal
commitments of the previous years. Heath would need assurance that
Lockheed would indeed stay in business and would not abandon the
L-1011. Haughton would need more money from his bankers to give him a
base from which to offer such guarantees. He also would have to pay
more for his engines, while waiving penalties for late deliveries.
For their part, the airlines would have to accept higher prices and
later deliveries for their airplanes, again without receiving penalty
payments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Haughton now was the man who had to make it
come together. He had a prodigious capacity for work, on which he now
drew. Often he had flown in from the East Coast in his Lockheed
JetStar, sleeping en route on a couch, checking in at home for a
quick shower, then reaching his desk at three or four in the morning
to begin his day's work. He also had extensive experience as a
salesman. In this business this certainly did not make him a Willy
Loman in the play by Arthur Miller, riding on a smile and a
shoeshine. It meant, rather, that although he was Lockheed's
chairman, he had a strong personal involvement in its sales. If an
airline executive raised a question, Haughton himself might turn up
the next day in that person's office to answer it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In dealing with his banks and airlines,
Haughton had to do a lot of hand-holding. Two financiers, one a
vice-president from Bank of America and the other a vice-president
from Bankers Trust, accompanied him on his travels, as
representatives of the entire banking syndicate. Still, each airline
and every bank would have to agree that such a deal would represent
the best possible outcome for its investors and stockholders. Each of
them would naturally prefer to hold back and try for better terms.
All would have to agree at the same time, however, or the chance for
a deal would fall through. As Nixon's treasury secretary, John
Connally, put it, "Dan, your trouble is you're chasing one possum at
a time up a tree. What you've got to do is get all those possums up
the tree at the same time."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The most elusive of those possums would be the
U.S. government. Early that spring, Haughton became aware that he
could build a fragile arch that might support Lockheed, Rolls, and
the L-1011. Its keystone, however, would be a new line of bank credit
totaling $250 million. Lockheed lacked the assets
[<A NAME="326"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">326</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] to pledge as collateral, and its creditors would
certainly demand security. That might be available, however, through
a federal loan guarantee, a pledge that the Treasury would reimburse
the banks if Lockheed should fold. On May 6, Connally met with Nixon
at the White House and announced that the Administration would send
the necessary legislation to Congress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There it would face a minefield of opposition.
Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
had blocked federal support for the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad
only a year earlier. He was highly skeptical of the proposed Lockheed
loan guarantee. Senator William Proxmire, slayer of the SST and a
harsh critic of Lockheed, was ready to filibuster against the bill.
Though Lockheed was an important defense contractor, the L-1011 was
entirely a commercial venture. If the firm went bankrupt, the
Pentagon would find a way to rescue its military projects, most
likely by having other aerospace firms buy up the pertinent company
divisions. Moreover, the L-1011 was to use British engines, a point
that did not escape the attention of lawmakers with ties to General
Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. An alternative, the DC-10, was
already on the verge of entering service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Weighing against these arguments was a single
word: jobs. Haughton, testifying before Patman's committee, stated
that as many as 60,000 people would be out of work if the L-1011 were
to fail. The Democratic Party, which controlled both House and
Senate, was still the party of Senator Hubert Humphrey, the
presidential nominee of 1968 and a strong labor man. Having shot down
the SST as recently as March, Congress could not lightly affront the
unions a second time, particularly since the country was still in a
recession. Moreover, 1972 would be an election year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The outcome was thin indeed. On July 30, the
House approved the bill, 192 to 189. The measure then moved to the
Senate, which was to recess for a month on Friday, August 6.
Haughton, however, had warned that by September, Lockheed would be
out of cash. The Senate leadership responded by bringing the bill to
a vote the previous Monday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">California's Senator Alan Cranston, a
principal backer, had been doing the nose-counting and calculated
that it would lose by the margin of a single vote. He tried to win
over Lee Metcalf of Montana, whose no vote seemed soft, and as the
calling of the roll reached its conclusion, Metcalf saw that his vote
was likely to be decisive. He told Cranston, "I'm not going to be the
one [<A NAME="327"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">327</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] to put those
thousands of people out of work." He voted yes, and the loan
guarantee passed by a margin of 49 to 48. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">37</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With this, the main stone of Haughton's arch
fitted into place. The threat of a Lockheed bankruptcy receded, while
Rolls now could emerge from its own receivership. With its RB-211, it
would become a leader in the business of building engines for
wide-body airliners. In turn, Lockheed now was free to proceed with
its L-1011.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aftermaths</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The L-1011 did not succeed in the market.
Though the program went through development and production, Lockheed
went on to construct only 252 of these airliners, rolling out the
last in 1983. The program did not earn back its development costs; in
fact, this firm sold few if any at a profit, for this company faced
strong competition first from the DC-10 and later from the Boeing 767
and Airbus A-300. Hence to win further sales, Lockheed had to offer
prices that were very low. The program had received over $1.7 billion
at the time of the near-collapse of Rolls; the final losses, at the
time of program cancellation, came to $2.5 billion. With this,
Lockheed retired from the ranks of the commercial planebuilders and
proceeded to make its living entirely as a military contractor.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By contrast, Boeing came back strongly
following its own brush with bankruptcy. Though the company's
sweeping layoffs were painful, they were part of a set of management
reforms that brought sharp reductions in the time necessary to build
a 707, 727, or 737. In 1966, this had averaged 17 months, from
customer order to delivery. By 1972, it was down to 11 months. "You
may ask why the hell we didn't do that earlier," said Jack Steiner.
"We never had to. We could have done better. Any time you're
threatened with extinction you develop abilities you didn't know
existed."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In turn, the company saved itself by offering
new versions of its narrow-bodied 727 and 737. To compete with the
wide-bodies, they needed new [<A NAME="328"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">328</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] features: longer
range, quiet engines, low operating cost, plenty of seats for the
purchase price. Boeing introduced such improvements, which amounted
to offering more airplane for the purchaser's dollars, and won new
income through increased sales.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the nadir, in 1971, Boeing indeed had been
close to ruin. Production of the 707, 727, and 737 was forecast to
fall to three per month during 1972 (not three of each model but
three of the entire group). The SST was dead, and sales of the 747
were flat. As sales of the improved 727 and 737 took hold, prospects
did brighten. By late 1974, production of the three narrow-bodies was
up to 15 a month. Debt went down rapidly; in 1973 alone, Boeing paid
off nearly half a billion dollars. Better yet, orders for the 747
finally picked up. In 1978, the company was back on its feet and was
strong enough to launch not one but two new programs: the 757 and
767. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">39</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The demise of the SST might have opened a
major opportunity for the Concorde. Early in 1973, however, Pan Am
declined to exercise its option to purchase these airliners, noting
"significantly less range, less payload and higher operating costs
that are provided by the current and prospective widebodied jets."
TWA, Pan Am's principal rival, followed suit by declining to exercise
its own option, with its chairman noting Concorde's "dismal
economics."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Significantly, these U.S. carriers made these
decisions nearly a year before the energy crisis sent the price of
fuel soaring. The airlines of the 1960s had grown rapidly in an era
of cheap fuel; the price of jet fuel was only 11 cents a gallon in
1973, and builders of the SST expected the price to stay at this
level for the next two decades. Needless to say, it did not; to the
contrary, the second and more severe oil crisis, in 1979, pushed this
price above a dollar per gallon. Though this hurt all of commercial
aviation, it particularly hurt Concorde whose supersonic speed
demanded high fuel consumption. In the end, only 14 of these aircraft
entered service, divided equally between British Airways and Air
France. Taxpayers' subsidies built those planes, and to paraphrase
Sir Winston Churchill, rarely have so many given so much for so
little. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">40</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="329"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">329</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] These developments
unfolded in the wake of the House and Senate votes of 1971. As
exercises in raw vote-counting, the narrow margin of the Lockheed
loan guarantee-192 to 189 in the House, 49 to 48 in the
Senate-recalls the near-death of NASA's shuttle/station a year
earlier, which survived by 53-53 in the House and 32-28 in the
Senate. Even the players were the same, with Senators Walter Mondale
and William Proxmire playing active roles in both controversies.
Proxmire had also taken the lead in the fight against the
SST.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">41</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The two votes, however, had very different
meanings. The shuttle/station was a standard federal project, of the
type that NASA had been set up to pursue. Though critics challenged
the wisdom and desirability of such an enterprise, no one sought to
repeal the Space Act of 1958, which had created NASA and gave it the
charter to pursue such initiatives. In turn, this challenge proved to
be addressable through such means as having the shuttle stand on its
own, supporting it with an Air Force endorsement, and allowing the
station to fade in significance. By mid-1971, the Shuttle was well
past its time of danger in Congress, as its funding authorization
passed the House on a voice vote and the Senate by a vote of 64 to
22. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In both the SST and Lockheed debates, however,
the issues were more far-reaching. Though the drama of
environmentalism captured the headlines, the SST debate also
introduced a disturbing economic question: Was the federal government
to provide funding for this project as a risky venture that could not
win financial support in the private sector? Similarly, the Lockheed
loan guarantee amounted to proposing that Washington should
underwrite a line of credit that this firm could not back with
collateral, and that therefore was also too risky for banks.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Neither of these ventures were simple
exercises in corporate welfare. Federal support for the SST was to be
repaid through royalties from sales. Recall the remarks of the
project manager, William Magruder, that the SST
[<A NAME="330"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">330</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] would return a profit to the government by selling
500 of these airliners. Similarly, the funds advanced to Lockheed
came from banks, not from the Treasury, with the loan guarantee
merely providing security in lieu of collateral. Both ventures,
however, were controversial because they opened the door for the
government to assume risks that had traditionally rested within the
domain of corporate finance, with its banks and securities
markets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the face of these well-founded objections,
the House and Senate nevertheless voted to support Lockheed, even
though their members were well aware that they might be setting an
unwelcome precedent for further such interventions. In doing this,
Congress showed that it would fight the aerospace recession by
passing a measure-the Lockheed loan guarantee-that went well beyond
the usual demand for pork-barrel spending to provide jobs during hard
times. This meant that to support the aerospace industry in its time
of difficulty, Washington would go the extra mile and would enact
legislation that ordinarily it would not consider. Against this
background, the Shuttle, which had stirred such controversy during
1970, appeared in 1971 as a straightforward initiative that could win
backing on its merits. In this spirit, though continuing to face
opposition within the Office of Management and Budget, the shuttle
would gain support where it counted most: from Nixon himself.</FONT>
