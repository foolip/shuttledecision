The concept had taken form in an era when radio was the onlywell-developed electronic technology. It was easy, therefore, toimagine that space flight would demand large orbiting crews toconduct satellite communications, weather observation, and militaryreconnaissance. Like a base in Antarctica, the space station wouldsupport these crews with comfortable accommodations inside acentralized facility.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This point of view appeared not only in thewritings of Wernher von Braun, but in the work of his fellowvisionary Arthur C. Clarke. In 1945, Clarke proposed buildingcommunications satellites in geosynchronous orbit, at an altitude of22,300 miles. They would circle the earth every 24 hours, to remainfixed in position in the sky:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Using material ferried up by rockets,   it would be possible to construct a "space-station" in such an   orbit. The station could be provided with living quarters,   laboratories and everything needed for the comfort of its crew,   who would be relieved and provisioned by a regular rocket   service…. Since the gravitational stresses involved in the   structure are negligible, only the very lightest materials will be   necessary and the station could be as large as   required.</FONT></I>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="56"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">56</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">Let us now suppose that such a station were built in   this orbit. It could be provided with receiving and transmitting   equipment…and could act as a repeater to relay transmissions   between any two points on the hemisphere beneath, using any   frequency which will penetrate the ionosphere</FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even then, in 1945, rocket researchers werebroadening the use of radio by introducing telemetry: the automatedtransmission of instrument readings. Telemetry developed in thetechnology of weather balloons, which could carry meteorologicalinstruments to high altitudes. By transmitting the instrumentreadings, telemetry eliminated the need to physically recover theinstruments following a long flight. In addition to this, weatherballoons (and rockets) required equipment of minimal weight. DuringWorld War II, telemetry was used actively diuring test flights of theV-2. After that war, when Von Braun brought his V-2s to the U.S. andcarried out a program of instrumented flights in New Mexico,telemetry again played an important role. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In space flight, telemetry made it possible toenvision automated spacecraft. As part of the </FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> series, VonBraun offered a proposal for such a craft in 1953. It was to carryrhesus monkeys, along with a TV camera for observation of clouds andweather patterns. </FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">Collier's</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> called it a"baby space station," describing it as the "first step in theconquest of space." Chesley Bonestell, in his lyric style, portrayedit in a closeup view, soaring high over New York City.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This spacecraft, however, would serve as aprelude to the full-size space station; in no way would it representa substitute. In Von Braun's words, "We scientists can have the babyrocket within five to seven years if we begin work now. Five yearslater, we could have the manned space station."</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two other technical developments allowedautomated satellites to come into their own. The first was thedevelopment of electronic circuits that had long life. Largely fromthe work at Bell Telephone Laboratories, it was here that the firsttransistors took form. Bell Labs also introduced the solar cell, athin wafer of silicon that could transform sunlight directly intoelectric current.

Crews in their orbiting stations wouldspend a great deal of time replacing vacuum tubes. The situation wasnot much different in 1953, when Von Braun proposed his "baby spacestation." He envisioned a time in orbit of only 60 days, which wasabout as much as he could expect given the limits of circuitry atthat time. As early [<A NAME="58"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">58</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] as 1958, however,the Vanguard 1 satellite demonstrated the prospect of long life. Itlacked instruments and carried only a radio transmitter, powered bysolar cells and was able to transmit for over sixyears.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another important development brought theadvent of spacecraft that could operate autonomously and return fromorbit. This project, known as the Corona project, was run by theCentral Intelligence Agency, with Lockheed as the contractor. Theirspacecraft, called the Discoverer, was able to stabilize while inorbit and point a lens at the earth below. They also operated anautomated camera, winding the exposed film into a protected cassette.At an appropriate moment, the spacecraft then released a reentrycapsule that fired a retro-rocket. The capsule deployed a parachuteto land within a specified target area. Air Force cargo planes werethen often able to snatch the capsule in mid-air.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It took over a dozen satellite launches beforethe CIA got this complex system to work successfully. While the firstlaunch, Discoverer 1, flew in February 1959, it was not untilDiscoverer 13 and 14, in August 1960 that the program achievedsuccess.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> Its significance then was undeniable. The analystJeffrey Richelson described space reconnaissance as "one of the mostsignificant military technological developments of this century andperhaps in all history. Indeed, its impact on postwar internationalaffairs is probably second only to that of the atomic bomb. Thephoto-reconnaissance satellite, by dampening fears of what weaponsthe other superpower had available and whether military action wasimminent, has played an enormous role in stabilizing the superpowerrelationship." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These developments-telemetry, long-lifeelectronics, onboard autonomy-completely changed the prospects forspace flight. No longer would it be necessary to build Von Braun's7000-ton cargo rockets or to support large crews in orbitingstations. Instead, the nation would proceed by developing launchvehicles from the ICBMs and similar missiles that the Air Force wasbuilding for military purposes. Satellites would take shape asinstrumented craft of modest size and weight. In turn, the spacestation ceased to hold the attention of visionaries such as VonBraun, who went on to influence policy. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="59"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">59</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p59.htm"><IMG SRC="p59s.jpg"ALT="Cutaway view of the Corona satellite reconnaissance system.

The goal, instead, was to landastronauts on the moon. In doing this, NASA completely bypassed theclassic approach of first building a space station and then using itas a base or staging area for the lunar mission. Instead, as a singleSaturn V rocket carried a complete moonship with a crew of three,NASA went for the moon in one fell swoop,.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The concept of an orbiting station, however,did not go away.

Kennedy's effort aimedat a moon landing; it was easy to imagine a permanent base on themoon. A space station, in earth orbit, could demonstrate and testmany critical technologies. As an essential prelude to an eventualmission to Mars, it also could test the ability of astronauts toremain healthy when living for long periods in zero gravity.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The architecture of such stations alsochanged.

During the1960s, he was director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, wherelarge launch vehicles were a specialty. As he stated in 1962, "we canstill carry an idea for a space vehicle… from the concept through theentire development cycle of design, development, fabrication, andtesting." His domain included the Michoud Assembly Facility near NewOrleans, where complete Saturn V first stages were assembled.

Mueller had been vice president of the firm of SpaceTechnology Laboratories in Los Angeles, a division of TRW and a primesource of technical support for the Air Force's principal missileprograms. Mueller had been deeply involved in the Minuteman ICBMeffort, and had pushed successfully for "all-up testing," duringwhich that missile fired all three stages and flew to its full rangeon its first flight.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="62"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">62</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Coming to NASA in1963, he quickly became convinced that he could do the same with theSaturn V. Von Braun had used a cautious step-by-step approach indeveloping the earlier Saturn I, flight-testing only the first stagebefore committing to flights of the complete two-stage launchvehicle. Mueller decided that similar caution in flight testing ofSaturn V's three stages would push the first lunar landing into thenext decade. He won Von Braun's consent to allow Saturn V to fly"all-up" on its first flight by firing all three of its stages.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This quickened the pace of development on theApollo, making it likely that the Saturn V would become available ata relatively early date. It also hastened the day when Von Braun'scenter would largely complete its work and face layoffs. Mueller'sdecision, however, also made it likely that surplus Saturn-classrockets would become available and used for purposes other thandirect support of moon landings.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In August 1965, Mueller set up a newSaturn-Apollo Applications Program Office. The Saturn I-B emerged asan early focus for attention. This powerful rocket conducted only alimited program of developmental flights for Apollo before giving wayto the much larger Saturn V. The Saturn I-B's second stage, theS-IVB, had a liquid-hydrogen propellant tank with a volume of nearly10,000 cubic feet. There was interest in turning the S-IVB into anorbiting workshop. Mueller later stated that this would match thevolume of "a small ranch house. The kind I can afford to buy."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By early 1967, the program called for aninitial mission featuring two launches. The first would carry anApollo spacecraft with its crew of three; the second would launch theworkshop, mounted to an airlock and docking adapter. The S-IVB,modified for use in orbit, was to sprout large solar panels alongwith two floors within the 21-foot wide hydrogen tank. These floorswould provide living quarters and work areas. The flight crew wouldrendezvous with the workshop and dock with the adapter. Inside thespent fuel tank, these astronauts would find an empty, bare-walledspace that would require four days of fitting-out to turn intohabitable living quarters. The crew would then stay in space for 28days conducting biomedical tests as their principal activity. Asubsequent mission to the workshop would bring a fresh crew to livein space for 56 days. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="63"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">63</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] In addition toMueller's powerful Office of Manned Space Flight, a separate NASAprogram center, the Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA),made its own contribution to the new post-Apollo effort. Within thefield of space science, OSSA supported solar astronomy, usingspacecraft to observe the sun's at ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengthsthat do not penetrate the atmosphere. In 1962 and 1965, two OrbitingSolar Observatory spacecraft returned a great deal of useful data andsparked interest in an advanced automated solar observatory. Suchplans fit the cyclic activity of the sun itself, which, every 11years, rises to a peak in the number of sunspots, radiation levels,and magnetic activity. The next such peak was to occur in 1969,leaving ample time for development of the new spacecraft.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">OSSA's plans fit the solar cycle much betterthan the budget cycle. OSSA had little clout, and the demands ofApollo were all-consuming; pressed by its budgetary needs, scientificsatellites tended to fall by the wayside. The head of OSSA, HomerNewell, was undismayed. Though his advanced automated observatoryfailed to win support and had to be canceled, Newell saw that hecould seek an even more ambitious solar observatory by hitching hiswagon to the star of piloted space flight. Working with Mueller,Newell developped a concept for an Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), as asecond important component of Apollo Applications.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This ATM took shape as a substantialspacecraft in its own right. Requiring its own Saturn I-B to carry italoft, it also called for its own set of solar panels that wouldunfold to form a large cross. The program plan called for it torendezvous with the orbiting workshop early in the 56-day secondmission. The astronauts would move it into position and install it aspart of the complete space laboratory. With a dozen instruments, theATM would test the ability of astronauts to conduct useful scientificresearch by operating sophisticated equipment in orbit.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These missions were to herald a major program.Released in March 1966, NASA's initial schedule envisioned 26launches of the Saturn I-B and 19 of the Saturn V. Flight hardwarewould include three S-IVB stages intended for on-orbit habitation,four ATMs, and three more capable space stations that would ride atopthe Saturn V. The Bureau of the Budget (BoB), an arm of the WhiteHouse, was not encouraging.

Inaddition to this, with Apollo reaching the peak of its funding, thoseofficials were in no mood to allow NASA to launch another costlyprogram.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Initial discussions focused on the budgetrequest for FY 1967 that President Johnson would present to Congressearly in 1966. Mueller hoped at first for $450 million, with over $1billion in FY 1968. Bureau of the Budget officials preferred to startby offering $100 million, though they were willing to listen toarguments for $250 million. This part of NASA's budget includedApollo. To keep it on schedule, Mueller had to put ApolloApplications under a particularly severe squeeze with only $42million (less than a tenth of his initial budget mark) for FY 1967.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">15</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The FY 1968 budget brought more of the same.Initial discussions between NASA and the BoB chopped the request from$626 million to $454 [<A NAME="65"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">65</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] million, a sum thatwould get the program off to a good start at least. In his budgetmessage to Congress, Johnson endorsed this figure with an argumentthat would be heard again in subsequent years: "We have noalternative unless we wish to abandon the manned space capability wehave created." Though Johnson and the BOB were now on board,Congress, which cut the authorization to $347 million, was not. Noteven the appropriation-more bad news at $300 million-was safe, as theNASA Administrator, James Webb, transferred part of it to otheractivities. Apollo Applications was left with only $253 million, thelowest level Mueller could accept. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">16</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It nevertheless was enough, barely, to get theprogram under way and turn it into something more than a designexercise. As serious engineering activity got under way, however,designers came to realize that they were pursuing an approach markedwith pitfalls. The approach continued to call for a "wet workshop," apropulsive stage that would then serve as living and working quarterswhile in orbit. After reaching orbit, however, astronauts would haveto convert the empty fuel tank into these quarters and install a gooddeal of equipment. As studies proceeded, it became increasinglydoubtful that all this could be done.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The alternative would be to build the spacestation as a "dry workshop"with no provision for use as a rocketstage. Unable to propel itself into orbit, the dry workshop wouldneed the heavy lifting power of a Saturn V. That rocket's payloadcapacity would make it possible to incorporate the ATM from theoutset, rather than having to bring it up on a separate flight. Thecomplete, well-integrated space station could undergo tests andverification on the ground.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While studies of a dry workshop were beingconducted at the same time as those of the wet version, they werenever endorsed by NASA Administrator James Webb. The sticking pointwas the need for a Saturn V. The historians Charles Benson and DavidCompton note that "it had taken all of Webb's power of persuasion toconvince Congress and the BoB that Apollo required at least 15 SaturnV launch vehicles, and he would tolerate no suggestion that any couldbe used for something else."</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> When Webbresigned from NASA in October 1968, he took his objections with him.In addition to this, in [<A NAME="66"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">66</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] December 1968,Apollo 8 carried three astronauts on a successful flight that orbitedthe moon and returned safely. This was only the third flight of aSaturn V, making it highly plausible that it would indeed be possibleto spare one of those behemoths for Apollo Applications.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the mounting technical problems of thewet workshop approach, Mueller became convinced that it simply wasnot practical. Hence, only a dry workshop could save the program. Thenew NASA Administrator Thomas Paine became convinced in 1969 that itwas necessary to make the switch. His decision was subject only tothe success of Apollo 11, the planned first lunar-landing mission. Hesigned the project-change document on July 18, while Apollo 11 was enroute to the moon. Four days later, with the landing accomplished andthe astronauts homeward bound, the Apollo Applications programmanager, William Schneider, sent telexes to the NASA centers thatdirected them to proceed with the dry workshop.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Program cutbacks, however, had taken theirtoll. Apollo Applications, initially conceived as a long-runningextension of Apollo, was down to a single workshop supported by threeastronaut crews flying the Saturn I-B. There was hope for a secondworkshop that would carry different equipment. The committeeconsidered close to a hundred possibilities for a new name for theprogram, including "Socrates" and "LSD." The winning name, "Skylab,"came from Lieutenant Colonel Donald Steelman, an Air Force officer onduty with NASA. The new name, which replaced Apollo Applications, wasformally adopted in February 1970. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Space Station Concepts of the1960s</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There was only a single Skylab orbitingworkshop in existence.

Nevertheless, it represented no morethan a half-step toward that goal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="67"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">67</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Skylab grew out ofApollo Applications, which merely sought to make good use of Apollolaunch vehicles and equipment. Though the Skylab spacecraft stronglymodified the standard S-IVB rocket stage, its design was heavilyconstrained. The 22-foot diameter of Skylab followed from thediameter of the S-IVB, even though the Saturn V could accommodatepayloads of up to 33 feet across. Similarly, although Skylab includedthe ATM as part of its package, its total weight, 165,000 pounds,fell well short of the lifting power of the Saturn V. Theserestrictions arose because the dry workshop, which used the Saturn V,developed out of the wet workshop, which was to have used the muchsmaller Saturn I-B. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, Skylab was not permanentlyinhabited. It supported three crews in orbit, during 1973 and 1974,who stayed respectively for 28, 59 and 84 days. Though the last suchmission continues to hold the record for duration in U.S.-builtspacecraft, Soviet and Russian cosmonauts have stayed in orbit for upto 437 days in the Mir station. Following the return of the thirdSkylab crew, in February 1974, NASA made no further attempt to usethis valuable facility. Skylab's orbit, left to decay, burned up inthe atmosphere in July 1979. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Amid its limitations and its shrinkingbudgets, Apollo Applications, however, was important. Not just apaper study, it was a true and funded program, with a project officeat NASA Headquarters that stood alongside similar offices for Geminiand Apollo.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> It thus gaveconsiderable hope to those in both NASA and the industry who werecarrying out studies for the next space station. During the 1960s, anumber of studies sought to define such a station.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's Langley Research Center took an earlyinterest in such studies, setting up a space station office withinits Applied Mechanics and Physics Division. Early work, from 1959 to1962, focused anew on the rotating-wheel configuration. At theoutset, the Langley designers considered a range of shapes that couldrotate to provide artificial gravity.

Late in 1963, Douglas Aircraft won this studycontract and went on to build the Skylab workshop. In many ways, MORLillustrated what Apollo Applications might have accomplished if ithad been given high priority and ample funding.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rather than seeking to support large crews inthe comfort of artificial gravity, MORL emphasized small crews thatwould live in weightlessness in versatile, compact stations. Thebasic station was to fly atop a Saturn I-B and hence had thatrocket's diameter of 22 feet. Weighing 30,000 pounds at launch, MORLwould enclose 9000 cubic feet of internal volume, with a crew of six.Each astronaut would serve a six-month tour of duty. A modifiedApollo spacecraft, riding its own Saturn I-B, would carry suppliesalong with new three crew members to the space station.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Specialized equipment would enhance theusefulness of MORL. It would carry astronomical telescopes. Acrew-tended radar would support large-scale topographical mapping.Douglas Aircraft also proposed to install a nine-lens camera systemfor observation of the earth's surface and weather at a variety ofwavelengths. With astronauts tending a lab full of plants, animalsand [<A NAME="70"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">70</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] bacteria, additionalmodules would research new fields such as life sciences. The additionof other such modules would allow the basic station to expand tohouse nine astronauts rather than the original six. Selected crewmembers would remain in orbit for as long as a year.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Use of the Saturn V would enable the MORL tofly in orbits as high as 23,000 miles while continuing to receiveresupply. The MORL would be able to fly to lunar orbit to map themoon's surface. It would be able to land on the moon and to serve asa base. Serving as a test bed for systems intended for use in apiloted mission to Mars, MORL also might evolve into an importantelement of a spacecraft built to carry out such a mission. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston,other investigators agreed that a space station could represent anintermediate step toward a mission to Mars. That center had its ownspace station group that had contracted with the Space Division ofthe Boeing Co. to conduct the pertinent study. Completed in 1967,that study envisioned a Mars spaceship that also could serve as anearth-orbiting station.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Mars ship would take the form of atwo-deck module, 22 feet in diameter, with room for both crew membersand equipment. For use as a space station, the vehicle would add asecond module, together with a central section, midway along thestation, that could accommodate the docking of two Apollo spacecraft.With a weight of 248,000 pounds, this complete station would ride aSaturn V to orbit. It would support a crew of eight, with theseastronauts flying on the Saturn I-B, in Apollo craft modified tocarry four rather than the usual three people. Two such launcheswould provide the initial staff. Subsequent flights every 90 dayswould bring fresh crew members as well as new supplies. The stationwould remain continuously occupied for two years.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Without resupply or revisit en route, the Marsmission would also last two years. Mission designers would chop thespace station in two, retrieving the basic two-deck module andstaffing it with a crew of four. After being placed in orbit by asingle Saturn V launch, additional Saturn V flights would carryfully-fueled S-IVB stages to boost the Mars ship toward itsdestination. While it would fly past and not land on that planet oreven orbit it, the mission would drop off planet probes, landers, andan orbiter during this flyby.

An alternateviewpoint stressed the usefulness of such stations for science alone.This view found support at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. A1966 study there noted that a proper science station could not be allthings to all people. It was argued that different sciences wouldimpose characteristic demands that would be mutuallyincompatible.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Astronomy in space, for example, would requiregamma-ray, x-ray, optical, and radio telescopes. These would have topoint in fixed directions during their observations, maintainingstability to within 0.001 degrees. A due-east launch from CapeCanaveral could put them in orbit, with an inclination to the equatorof 28 degrees. By contrast, observation of the earth's surface andweather would ideally require a polar orbit that demands more energyat launch. An earth-observing station would have to turn slowly topoint continually downward, rather than stand at a fixed position inspace. It could work [<A NAME="72"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">72</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] with a stability of0.05 degrees. Biomedical experiments, including long-duration studiesof the human response to weightlessness, would be even lessdemanding. Able to work in any orbit, they would dispense with thecostly control systems necessary for pointing andstabilization.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Marshall study thus called for twostations, each with a crew of nine and a lifetime of five years forthe station. They would fly to orbit atop the S-IVB stage of a SaturnV. One station, supporting astronomy, would fly due east from theCape. The second station, supporting meteorology and earthobservations, would not use the hard-to-reach polar orbit, but wouldachieve an intermediate inclination of 55 degrees. This inclinationwould still permit coverage of the world's major land masses.Biologists and life-science specialists, not requiring a specificorbit, could build a specialized module that could fly as part ofeither station. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">27</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is important to note that these studieslacked the support of a NASA Headquarters program office similar tothat of Apollo Applications after 1965. These studies, however, didhave the attention of center directors. In 1963, the original MORLStudies Office reported directly to Floyd Thompson, the director ofNASA-Langley.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">28</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Similarly, itwas no secret that Wernher von Braun, director of NASA-Marshall, hada strong and ongoing interest in space stations. With no one atHeadquarters who was ready to take those studies and push for theirfulfillment, the space station represented only a possible newdirection for NASA. In no way was there a commitment to pursue thatdirection.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, these studies reflected thecharacteristic point of view that space stations could offerintrinsic advantages. In 1968, Robert Gilruth, director of the MannedSpacecraft Center, defined such a station as "a site in spacedeveloped to support men, experimental equipment, and operationspermanently and to take advantage of the favorable economies of size,centralization, and permanency-in terms of power, volume,instruments, communications, data reduction, and logistics."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> This amounted to an assertion that those "favorableeconomies" actually existed, a point from which both Congress and theBudget Bureau soon would differ.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Likewise, it was not easy to assume that spacestations would win support on their merits for use in science. Theconcepts of the day anticipated the routine[<A NAME="73"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">73</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] use of the Saturn I-B with the Apollo spacecraft forresupply and crew rotation. The Apollo 7 mission, which had flownatop the Saturn I-B in 1968, cost $145 million. Two years later, asingle flight of a Saturn V with its moonship would cost up to $375million. By contrast, in FY 1970, the National Science Foundation,which sponsors a broad range of basic research in a large number offields, received a budget of $440 million.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Indeed, itwould take a true believer to assert that a Saturn V, even with anApollo mission, could offer the scientific return of a year's worthof grants from the NSF to the nation's universities and researchcenters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This point was not lost on theadvanced-planning designers who were nurturing their space stations.They saw that the expensive Saturn V might not remain the only way tolaunch a large station; a reusable launch vehicle might cut costswhile offering even greater lifting power. In addition to this, itmight prove feasible to dispense with the Saturn I-B, replacing itwith a low-cost launcher of intermediate size. A number ofspecialists pursued these hopes during the 1960s, as they allowedtheir imaginations to run free. In pursuing their designs, they laida considerable amount of groundwork for the serious studies of aspace shuttle that followed.</FONT></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Early Studies of Low-Cost SpaceFlight</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">No one could deny that space flight wasexpensive. Launch vehicles flew only once. There was no way to reusethem; they launched their payloads and then splashed into the ocean.A Saturn I-B cost $45 million, excluding its Apollo spacecraft andflight operations; a Saturn V cost $185 million. For these rockets tocarry three astronauts costs as much as $60 million per person.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Advocates of reusable launch vehicles wouldsay that using throwaway Saturns was tantamount to flying a planeloadof passengers across the Atlantic and having that airliner fly onlyonce. It is a measure of the truly enormous cost of space flight thatthis comparison was off by three orders of magnitude. The Boeing 727,a popular jet of the 1960s, had a sticker price of $4.2 million. Itcarried 131 passengers. Had each such plane made only a singleflight, the cost of a ticket would have been some$30,000.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> The corresponding price for[<A NAME="74"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">74</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] a ticket on a Saturn V was 2,000 times greater.

Clearly, the nation wasunlikely to persist in this celestial potlatch unless it had the mostcompelling of reasons.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An initial step toward reusability came atNASA-Marshall during 1961 and 1962, where engineers sought to learnwhether a high-performance rocket engine could survive a dunking inseawater. They worked with the H-1, a standard engine from Rocketdynethat went on to power the Saturn I-B. Following immersion,investigators dismantled the engine, checked its parts for corrosion,reassembled it, and ran it successfully on a test stand. Thus, it wasproven that this powerful engine, rated at 187,000 pounds of thrust,could withstand a bath in seawater and return to service.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next question was whether a Saturn-classfirst stage could be recovered for reuse. There was considerableinterest in using a flexible and deployable wing invented by FrancisRogallo of NASA-Langley. The "Rogallo wing" later found its niche asa type of hang glider, allowing enthusiasts to fly from clifftops andsoar on uprising air like birds. It also was used as a directionalparachute, permitting a large booster to descend by gliding to adesignated recovery point.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Studies showed that this approach would notwork with existing first stages such as the Saturn I-B. Because theyhad not been designed for recovery, they lacked the storage room forthe furled Rogallo wing. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">35</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Thus, it wouldnot be possible to introduce reuse by the simple approach of mountinga deployable wing to a Saturn booster. Studies funded byNASA-Marshall, under the name "50- to 100-Ton Payload ReusableOrbital Carrier," showed, however, that NASA might achieve betterresults by installing fixed wings on the Saturn V's firststage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new first stage would use that booster'sstandard engines, adding landing gear, a pilot compartment,insulation to protect against the heat of atmosphere reentry, andlarge wings, sharply swept, with big vertical fins at the tips. Thesemodifications would add 300,000 pounds of weight. The[<A NAME="75"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">75</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] second stage, however, would retain its full liftingpower. Thus, the payload would be decreased by only 20percent.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Smaller winged rockets also drew interest, asanalyses showed that even with parachutes, recovery of any craft atsea would be both costly and clumsy. Leonard Tinnan, a manager atNAA, wrote that "in comparing parachute or other so-called 'simple'means of booster recovery with the 'sophisticated' fixed-wingapproach, for example, it becomes rather easy to demonstrate that theformer is economically superior-if the time and costs associated withthe mid-ocean retrieval and refurbishment of booster stages, and theimpact of corresponding extension of turnaround time, are omitted orminimized. In the final analysis, however, all such factors must befully considered." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">36</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A review of design concepts of the early 1960sshows that engineers were of two minds on approaches to reuse. Theprospect of aircraft-type operation tantalized a number of thesepeople, with the X-15 offering inspiration by flying routinely inflight test. Designers expected that their reusable launch vehicleswould fly often. For this they would need wings and runways becauserecovery at sea would hamper frequent flight schedules. Otherinvestigators wanted reusable launchers that would carry far morepayload than a Saturn V. Far too large for wings, such leviathanswould have to come down in the ocean.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Perhaps the largest of these reusablelaunchers was the Nexus. The work of a group at General Dynamics ledby Krafft Ehricke, the Nexus was to represent the next leap beyondthe Saturn V, carrying up to eight times more payload. Fully fueled,it would weigh 24,000 tons, as much as an ocean-going freighter. Itwould carry a 1,000 tons to orbit, allowing it to launch a spaceshipbound for Mars. This behemoth would have a diameter of 202 feet withits height approaching that of the Washington Monument. It would flyas a single-stage launch vehicle. Fully recoverable, it would touchdown in the ocean following a return from orbit. Parachutes wouldslow its descent. Retro-rockets, firing during the last seconds,would assure a gentle landing. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">37</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Others hoped to develop new types of engines.The years since World War II had brought enormous advances inturbojets, rockets, and ramjets.

Instead, this concept sought to allow a rocket to getits oxygen from air in the atmosphere. Because rocket engines operateat very high pressure, no air compressor could compress the ambientair so as to allow it to flow into a thrust chamber. If the air couldbe liquefied, however, it would form liquid air, which could bepumped easily to high pressure. LACE sought to do this by passing theincoming air through a heat exchanger that used supercold liquidhydrogen, chilling the air into liquid form. The engine then woulduse the hydrogen and liquefied air as propellants.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This approach drew strong interest atMarquardt Co., a Los Angeles propulsion-research firm. In tests atSaugus, California in 1960 and 1961, Marquardt engineers successfullydemonstrated a LACE design that used heat exchangers built by GarrettAiResearch. A film of those tests, shown at a conference of theInstitute of the Aeronautical Sciences in March 1961, shows liquidair coming down in a torrent, as seen through a porthole. Marquardtwent on to operate test engines with thrusts of up to 275 pounds.During these tests, LACE performed twice as well as conventionalhydrogen-fueled rockets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were further innovations as well.Four-fifths of air is nitrogen, which does not burn. The presence ofthis nitrogen reduced the performance of LACE by cooling the exhaustand demanding extra liquid hydrogen to accomplish liquefaction.Oxygen, however, liquefies at 90 degrees Kelvin while nitrogenliquefies at the lower temperature of 77 degress Kelvin. Thus, bycarefully controlling the heat-exchange process, oxygen in the aircould be liquefied preferentially. This represented a topic forfurther research. In 1967, at General Dynamics, a test of thisconcept demonstrated 90 percent effectiveness in excluding thenitrogen. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">39</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While LACE represented a new direction inrocket research, the scramjet represented advances in the design ofthe ramjet. Ramjet engines showed their power during the 1950s whenthe Lockheed X-7, an unpiloted missile,[<A NAME="78"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">78</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] reached Mach 4.31 or 2881 miles per hour setting arecord for the flight of airbreathing engines.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">40</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> This was closeto the speed limit of a ramjet. Air in such a ramjet, flowinginitially at supersonic speeds, had to slow to subsonic velocity inorder to burn the fuel. When it slows, an engine becomes hot andloses engine power.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For a ramjet to reach speeds well beyond Mach4, this internal airflow would have to remain supersonic. This wouldkeep the engine cool and prevent it from overheating. This alsoimposed the difficult problem of injecting, mixing, and burning fuelin such a supersonic airflow. Nevertheless, a number of people hopedto build such an engine, which they called a scramjet.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">41</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Scramjet advocates included AlexanderKartveli, the vice president for research and development at RepublicAviation, and Antonio Ferri, a professor at Brooklyn PolytechnicInstitute. During World War II, Ferri had been one of Europe'sleading aerodynamicists and had directed Italy's premier researchfacility, a supersonic wind tunnel. Kartveli was one of America'sleading airplane designers, crafting such fighter aircraft as theF-84 and the F-105. During the 1950s, his focus was on anotherproposed fighter, the XF-103 that was to use a ramjet to reach speedsof Mach 3.7 (2450 mph) and altitudes of 75,000 feet.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">42</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ferri, who worked as a consultant on thisproject, formed a close friendship with Kartveli. They complementedeach other professionally; Kartveli studying issues of aircraftdesign, Ferri emphasizing the details of difficult problems inaerodynamics and propulsion. As they worked together on the XF-103they each stimulated the other to think bolder thoughts. Among theboldest put forth first by Ferri, and then supported by Kartvelliwith more detailed studies, was the idea that scramjet-poweredaircraft would have no natural limits to speed or performance. Theycould fly to orbit, reaching speeds of Mach 25. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the Air Force, concepts such as LACE andscramjets drew support from Weldon Worth, technical director at theAero Propulsion Lab of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Beginning inabout 1960, Worth built up a program of basic research calledAerospaceplane. Not aiming at actually building an[<A NAME="79"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">79</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] airplane that would fly to orbit, the program pursueddesign studies and propulsion research that might lead to suchaircraft in the distant future. The propulsion efforts were oftenvery basic. When, in November 1964, Ferri succeeded in getting ascramjet to deliver thrust, it was impressive enough to merit an AirForce news release. Ferri went on to set a goal of 644 pounds ofthrust for his test engine; he managed 517 pounds, 80 percent of hisgoal. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">44</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aerospaceplane was too hot to keep underwraps.

One suchconcepts, the Astro from Douglas Aircraft, was a two-stagefully-reusable launch vehicle with payload of 37,150 pounds. Bothstages of the Astro were designed as lifting bodies and would burnhydrogen and oxygen, using rocket engines that were already underdevelopment.

The field, however, needed vigorous pruning to define themost promising approaches. Weilding their garden shears, a number ofinvestigators began to address some key questions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Was it worth waiting for the scramjet? Whileits performance far surpassed that of even the best rockets, itsdevelopment would take time and its prospects were not certain. Evenaccepting that the next generation of launch vehicles would continueto use rockets, there was the question of whether[<A NAME="82"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">82</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] such craft should take off horizontally, like anairplane. A booster, heavy with propellant, would need large, massivewings to do this. The vehicle, however, might ride a rocket-poweredsled that would accelerate to several hundred miles per hour, at nocost to the booster in onboard fuel.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1962, NASA-Marshall set out to address suchissues through design studies. The first step was to set standardsfor the design of launch-vehicle concepts. Each concept had to carryten passengers or ten tons of cargo. Aircraft-type approaches wereparamount, with Marshall stating that contractor designs "should becompatible with a philosophy used in the development of supersoniccommercial jet aircraft and should offer a potential commercialapplication in the late 1970s, such as operating the vehicle overglobal distances for surface-to-surface transport of cargo andpersonnel."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This study, called "Reusable Ten Ton OrbitalCarrier Vehicle," awarded contracts of $428,000 to Lockheed and of$342,000 to NAA. From June 1962 to December 1963, designers looked attwo-stage fully-reusable configurations that put fixed wings on bothstages, and carried through separate designs for both vertical andhorizontal launch. They also considered concepts that drew on the AirForce's Aerospaceplane, with advanced airbreathing engines to providepropulsion in the first stage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Subsequent studies investigated additionalalternatives and pursued design issues in greater depth. In 1965,General Dynamics defined a concept for a reusable second stage thathad the shape of a lifting body; both that firm and Lockheedconducted studies of first stages that could carry such a secondstage. First-stage concepts continued to cover both vertical andhorizontal launch. When using airbreathing engines, design choicesranged from conventional turbojet engines to scramjets. At GeneralDynamics the possibilities included LACE, for which that company hadan active experimental program.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These studies concluded that, withoutexception, rocket engines were preferable to airbreathers forfirst-stage propulsion. A leader in these efforts, Max Akridge ofNASA-Marshall wrote that "the economic advantage for the rocketengine was always about the same as the developmental cost of theairbreathing engine." Similarly, vertical takeoff proved to offer anadvantage over horizontal launch because the cost of developing arocket sled was not offset by lower weight and cost in the flightvehicle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These studies defined the preferred approachof NASA-Marshall's Future Projects Office which called for atwo-stage fully-reusable launch vehicle,... </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="83"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">83</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p83.htm"><IMG SRC="p83s.jpg"ALT="Three classes of advanced launch vehicle studied in 1966.

The FDL, conducting two designexercises during 1965, drew the interest of the Aeronautics andAstronautics Coordinating Board, a joint NASA-Air Force committee. InAugust 1965, this board set up a subpanel that spent the next yearreviewing technology and design concepts for reusable launchvehicles. The subpanel issued its report in September 1966.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rather than focus on a single type of craft,the subpanel took the view that advancing technology would permitincreasingly capable designs to emerge[<A NAME="84"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">84</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] in the relatively near future. By 1974, the nationmight have a vehicle, called Class I, in which a small reusablespacecraft would ride atop an expendable booster. The Saturn I-Bcould serve as this booster; Martin Marietta's proposed Titan III-Mwas another possibility, as was a new booster derived from the260-inch solid rocket motor that was then under development.Essentially, the spacecraft would be tantamount to an updated versionof the Dyna-Soar. In turn, two-stage fully-reusable configurations(counted as Class II), such as those of NASA-Marshall, could beavailable by 1978. By 1981, the prospects could broaden to includeClass III, featuring horizontal takeoff and a first stage powered byscramjets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Like others in the field, the authors of thisreport were optimistic. NASA's eventual space shuttle would fall intoClass I, with two solid boosters, an expendable propellant tank, anda reusable orbiter.

It was areminder that development of a new Dyna-Soar was a quick route toreusability. In addition to this, in the words of the report'ssummary, "It is important to note that no single, most desirablevehicle concept could be identified by the Subpanel for satisfyingfuture DoD and NASA objectives."

Most managers and senior designershad entered the realm of space flight by way of the Pentagon'smissile program of the 1950s. Few of them had working knowledge ofthe standard methodology for determining the operating costs ofcommercial airliners, as published initially in 1940 and subsequentlyadopted by the Air Transport Association.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="85"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">85</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At Lockheed Missilesand Space Company, Max Hunter was one of the few people in theindustry with an intimate knowledge of both airline economics and oflaunch-vehicle design. Earlier in his career, working at DouglasAircraft, he had spent two and a half years dealing with theperformance of transport aircraft. In those days, Douglas ruled theskies with its DC-6 and DC-7 airliners. For some time, Hunter was incharge of all calculations on their performance and economics. Hethen joined the Thor missile project and served as chief designengineer. Rebuilt with upper stages, the Thor became the Delta launchvehicle and emerged as NASA's most widely used booster.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This background allowed Hunter to approach theproblem of low-cost space transportation from a fresh perspective.Existing studies left him dissatisfied; he writes that "by the end of1963 the state of recoverable rockets was terrible." He dislikedtwo-stage fully-reusable concepts which to him meant building twovehicles to do the work of one, with the smaller of the two-thesecond stage-being the one that counted. He also felt that thetechnology of scramjets or single-stage-to-orbit concepts lay far inthe future. By March 1964, however, he had the germ of a new idea:the stage-and-a-half configuration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This new idea was to consist of a reusablecore fitted with large expendable tanks that would hold most of thepropellant. The core would carry everything that was costly andimportant: phe work of his fellow visionary Arthur C. Clarke. In1945, Clarke proposed building communications satellites ingeosynchronous orbit, at an altitude of 22,300 miles. They wouldcircle the earth every 24 hours, to remain fixed in position in thesky:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Using material ferried up by rockets, it wouldbe possible to construct a "space-station" in such an orbit. Thestation could be provided with living quarters, laboratories andeverything needed for the comfort of its crew, who would be relievedand provisiayload, crew, engines, electronics, onboard systems. Witha heat shield on its underside, it would achieve complete reuse. Thetankage would consist of simple and inexpensive aluminum shells thatwould carry liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. They would fall awayduring the ascent to orbit, leaving the core to continue with themission.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hunter went to work at Lockheed in the fall of1965. On his first day, he was asked if there was anything he thoughtshould be done that was not being done already. He responded with aninternal company memo on orbital transportation, which drew theattention of a number of senior managers. These included Eugene Root,the president of LMSC, who provided the internal company support thatallowed Hunter to begin to pursue his ideas. He proceeded to take hisgospel to meetings of professional societies, and won funding fromthe Air Force. He particularly emphasized that the economic model ofthe Air Transport Association, though developed for airliners, couldapply as well to rocket transports.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="86"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">86</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Paradoxically,two-stage fully-reusable vehicles promised launch costs as low asone-third of Hunter's approach-but only when flying up to a hundredtimes per year. Because it had a far lower development cost for 10 orfewer flights per year, the stage-and-a-half had a decided advantage.In Hunter's words, "its development can consequently be justified atan earlier point in time with a smaller number of missions."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">55</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Hunter gave an airliner's view ofairplane-type space operations, NASA's George Mueller, head of theOffice of Manned Space Flight, was promoting such concepts as well.His domain included all of Apollo; he also was a strong proponent ofspace stations, and he was pushing vigorously for a strong ApolloApplications program. Looking to the future, he understood thatlow-cost space flight would be essential for viable spacestations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As a first step, in December 1967, he inviteda number of NASA and industry specialists to a one-day symposium,held in January at NASA Headquarters. Because much of the data fromindustry was proprietary, Mueller limited attendance torepresentatives of government agencies. Even so, some 80 people, mostof them from NASA and the Air Force, attended the conference. Thesymposium proceedings give a clear view of the topic at the end of1967, when the field was alive with ideas but when no single designapproach had come to the forefront. In addition to this, thoseproceedings presented design solutions that, four years later, wouldshow up in the final space-shuttle configuration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Martin Marietta was the most conservative,pitching its Titan III-M along with a small reusable spacecraft,similar to the Dyna-Soar, that would carry six people. This was thequintessential Class I design (featuring an expendable booster) thatNASA and the Air Force had identified in their 1966 joint study. TheTitan III-M was to rely on twin 120-inch solid boosters, slightlysmaller than the solid rockets that, 13 years later, would boost theoperational Space Shuttle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Those rockets were not built as single units,but rather as a stack of segments, like short lengths of pipelinethat are bolted together at their flanges. Manufacturers such asThiokol filled each segment with the solid propellant, then sent themoff by highway or railroad. Such segmented rockets were much easierto transport than the unsegmented type; the segments could be stackedand joined at the launch site, using putty to fill the gaps.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="87"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">87</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p87.htm"><IMG SRC="p87s.jpg"ALT="Titan III-M launch vehicle.

The firststage was also to grow in length, to hold more propellant, whilereceiving liquid-fueled engines with 11 percent more thrust.

Like Lockheed, it had adopted the stage-and-a-half approach,again with a reusable core flanked by expendable propellant tanks.Known as Tip Tank, this concept would carry 12 astronauts, sittingside by side like passengers in first class. The core again had theshape of a lifting body, but McDonnell went one better than Lockheedby proposing to add small wings that would fold within the fuselageand snap out for use in landing. These wings then would help thecraft to handle better during the landing approach, when conventionallifting bodies tended to dive toward a runway at speeds of severalhundred miles per hour. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">58</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas conceptscounted as only partially reusable, because their external tankswould not be recovered. During 1971, this became the configurationNASA would adopt; the shuttle orbiter would take shape as a corevehicle of the type Hunter had recommended. Its propellants would gointo a big expendable tank, with two large solids flanking this tankin the fashion of the Titan III-M. Hence as early as 1967, the basicelements of the eventual shuttle not only were well known but hadinfluential advocates among NASA's contractors.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At that early date, however, there was noreason to pick this approach over others that also had theiradvocates. The two-stage fully-reusable concept continued to shine,and General Dynamics, with Air Force support, had been studying aversion called the Triamese. It would feature a standard vehiclefitted with rocket engines and a pilot compartment. Like the core ofMcDonnell Douglas' Tip Tank, it was tantamount to a lifting body withdeployable wings. Three such vehicles, identical in shape, would fittogether to make a complete launch system. The middle vehicle wouldcarry the payload and would serve as the core; the other two wouldserve as tankage, carrying most of the propellant.

If thecriterion was to achieve the lowest possible cost per flight, thusattaining true airline-like operation, then one would go with thetwo-stage fully-reusable, even though this approach carried highdevelopment cost. If the most important goal was to achieve minimumdevelopment cost, then one would choose the Titan III-M.Stage-and-a-half configurations appeared intermediate, both indevelopment and in launch costs. In sum, one could choose a level ofreusability so as to balance between these two types of cost. As itsSpace Shuttle concepts matured, it is doing precisely this that NASAwould spend much of 1971.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="92"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">92</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The General Dynamicspresentation offered more. Within the industry, it was widelyappreciated that piloted aircraft cost much less to develop thanmissiles or expendable launch vehicles. The reason was that missilesdemanded extensive and costly ground tests to assure that they wouldfly properly, with no pilot at the controls. By contrast, thedevelopment of aircraft took full advantage of their reusability.Test pilots could start with simple exercises in taxying and takeoff,then reach toward higher speeds and greater levels of performance, instep-by-step programs. At each step, the aircraft would come back,where engineers could study it carefully and correct deficiencies.Such flight testing was far less costly than ground tests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">General Dynamics then drew on recentexperience with the X-15 and the Atlas ICBM, arguing that pilotedcraft could maintain this advantage even as rocket-powered vehiclesof extreme performance. The X-15 and Atlas had both gone throughdevelopment in the late-1950s; their empty weights were similar, andboth mounted rocket engines that came to their respective contractorsas government-furnished equipment. Although the X-15 was more complexthan Atlas, it had less than half the development cost because it toofollowed the step-by-step approach to flight test, with its testpilots often taking action to save the vehicle from disaster. Indeed,the X-15 would likely have been destroyed on as many as a third ofits flights had there been no pilot aboard. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">60</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Test pilotsthus served as inexpensive substitutes for the automated systems thatmight have been required to take their place.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The reusable concepts of the day, and thosethat followed during 1968 and 1969, were often referred to asIntegral Launch and Reentry Vehicles.

The term hadappeared now and then through the years. For example, Philip Bono ofDouglas Aircraft had offered a concept called the ROMBUS (ReusableOrbital Module, Booster, and Utility Shuttle). Dating to 1963, itresembled the immense Nexus, and its mission was similar. WalterDornberger, who had proposed to build Bomi during the 1950s, latelyhad been writing of a "recoverable and reusable space transporter, orshuttle." He described it as "an economical space plane capable ofputting a fresh egg, every morning, on the[<A NAME="93"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">93</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] table of every crew member of a space stationcircling the globe."

Mueller's hopes, however,contrasted sharply with recent experience, wherein NASA had tried andfailed to define an ambitious Apollo Applications effort as a majorpost-Apollo program.

The first significant interest in this issue came inJanuary 1964, when President Johnson, in office for barely twomonths, sent a letter to NASA Administrator James Webb.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The background to this letter involved aprogram of the Atomic Energy Commission called NERVA (Nuclear Enginefor Rocket Vehicle Application) that was developing a nuclear-poweredrocket engine.

The program had strong support from Senator Clinton Anderson(D-New Mexico), chairman of the Senate space committee; it also hadthe support of Webb. Its opponents, however, included PresidentKennedy's science advisor, Jerome Weisner. Weisner convinced Johnsonto ask NASA to identify the future missions that would requireNERVA's power.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Johnson took up this and other issues in hisletter to Webb. Could NASA list possible space objectives beyondthose already approved? What supporting research and developmentwould these new goals require? How much of NASA's current work,particularly in the development of launch vehicles such as the SaturnV, could support such future programs?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An old hand at Washington politics, Webbsmelled a rat. He later described this as "part of a power playrather than a desire for proposals. It[<A NAME="96"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">96</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] was an effort to put us on the defensive and to makeus commit ourselves to certain missions which they could thenattack." Accordingly, Webb did not reply immediately, but set up acommittee that proceeded to take its sweet time in preparing aresponse. Meanwhile he mollified Johnson with interim replies,listing possible future missions but declining to choose among them.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">64</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Events that summer showed that Webb was wiseto be cautious. As far back as 1962, the Future Projects Office atNASA-Marshall had contracted with several major aerospace firms forinitial studies of piloted planetary missions, including landing onMars. These studies continued during subsequent years. Then, inmid-1964, the new presidential science advisor, Donald Hornig, askedWebb to present an estimate of the cost of a piloted Mars landingthat might follow Apollo.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The initial estimate, internal to NASA, was$32 billion. An internal review added $5 billion for programcontingencies and forwarded the total of $37 billion to Webb. Heaccepted some further additions that hiked the cost to $50 billion,and gave this figure to Hornig. Hornig doubled it to $100 billion, onhis own initiative, and gave this new estimate to a Congressionalcommittee. The next day, newspapers quoted one congressman as statingthat the piloted Mars mission would cost $200 billion, amounting to40 years of NASA's budgets at the 1965 rate of $5 billion per year.In the words of an observer, "In only one week, a well developedestimate of $37 billion was multiplied into a $200 billion program."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">65</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A year after receiving his initial request,Webb finally gave a full reply to Johnson's letter in a reportwritten in February 1965. It amounted to a verbose exercise in sayinglittle that was new or significant and saying it at considerablelength, while offering no targets for skeptics. The report reviewedrecent and current NASA activities in detail, and included threesingle-page lists of future possibilities. These lists resembledpages from a book index, lacking any trace of description, estimatedcost, schedule, or priority. In an outstanding display of politicaladroitness, the report called for "a continued balanced program" thatwould "not impose unreasonably large demands upon the Nation'sresources." No one could oppose such recommendations; they were on apar with supporting motherhood and apple pie.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="97"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">97</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Webb's report drewquestions within the Senate space committee, which complained that"alternatives are presented, but no criteria are given as to how aselection would be made." That was just as Webb intended; he was notabout to take the initiative in offering a plan that critics couldattack. He would have been quite willing to have the President takethe lead, as Kennedy had done in supporting Apollo in 1961. Johnson,however, also preferred to keep his options open. In March 1965, hetold his advisor Jack Valenti that he did not intend to make a newKennedy-style commitment in space: "I think I would have more leewayand running room by saying nothing, which I would prefer."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">66</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian Arthur Levine notes that twoyears later, Webb explained to him just why he had finessed Johnson'sinitial request:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">First, the announcement by NASA in the   mid-1960s of a long-term goal would make the agency vulnerable. It   would provide ammunition to critics, who would be able to shoot   down the proposed program as being too expensive or impractical,   thereby raising the possibility that long-range technology   developments tied to the announced goal would be cut out. This in   turn would cripple the agency's ability to support the Apollo and   other advanced missions that depended on a strong base of   advancing technology.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Second, should NASA announce a   long-term post-Apollo goal, critics would claim that the lunar   landing was simply an interim goal, subordinate to the new effort.   For example, if NASA announced that the post-Apollo goal should be   a manned Mars landing, the Apollo program for a moon landing would   be relegated to a secondary position. This would raise the   possibility of cutting support for Apollo, thus jeopardizing the   program or stretching it out. In the event of subsequent change in   national opinion on the worth of the long-range goal, both the   lunar landing and the more distant goal might never be   realized.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Third, the major effort required for   planning, proposing, and defending a new long-range goal would tie   up the energies of top NASA leadership and key scientists and   engineers, diverting them from concentrating on making Apollo a   success.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">67</FONT></SUP></B></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="98"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">98</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The last pointaddressed the fact that there was no consensus, even within NASAitself, as to NASA's next goal. George Mueller, head of the Office ofManned Space Flight, had his eye on a piloted mission to Mars. Thetwo most powerful center directors, Von Braun at NASA-Marshall andRobert Gilruth of the Manned Spacecraft Center, preferred a differentobjective: a space station. Mueller also liked space stations and waswell aware of their usefulness as preparations for Mars. Von Braunand Gilruth, however, saw space stations as major elements of aprogram that, diverging sharply from one that would aim at Mars,would focus on activities in Earth orbit.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, during 1965 and 1966, thebeginnings of a post-Apollo future began to take shape. Notsurprisingly, its major features were in line with the initiativesthat Webb had suggested in his report to Johnson. Apollo Applicationsemerged, strongly backed by Mueller. For Mars, attention focused onan ambitious automated mission called Voyager that would orbit thatplanet and then send craft to land on its surface, looking withinstruments for signs of life. Plans for Voyager flourished for atime. While initial designs called for use of the Saturn I-B, inOctober 1965 its officials decided instead to try for the much largerSaturn V. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">68</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, even though Webb wasunwilling to carry through a serious plan for NASA's future, thePresident's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) proved willing to do itfor him. This blue-ribbon panel was potentially a source of clout; itoperated within the Executive Office of the President, and receivedsupport from another White House group, the Office of Science andTechnology. In February 1967, the PSAC issued a major report,</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Space Program in the Post-ApolloPeriod.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> John Newbauer, editor of thetrade journal </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Astronautics &amp;Aeronautics</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, wrote that it "shouldprove the pivot for policy discussions for some time to come." Hedescribed it as "the most cohesive and solid appraisal ofspace-program goals since the Space Act itself," which led to thefounding of NASA in 1958. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">69</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PSAC report did not endorse anything sospecific as piloted flight to Mars. Nevertheless, it proposed anorganizing theme: "a program directed ultimately at the explorationof the planets by man." The report defined this as "a[<A NAME="99"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">99</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] balanced program based on the expectation of eventualmanned planetary exploration." The program would pursue severalintermediate goals including continued lunar missions by astronauts;long-duration piloted flights, at first through Apollo Applicationsand later in a true space station; and "a strongly upgraded programof early unmanned exploration of the nearby planets."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The PSAC was certainly not in NASA's pocket;its report pulled no punches. It criticized the Apollo Applicationswet workshop: "some doubts arise about man's ability to carry outextensive construction efforts in space. The requirement that manactually construct his laboratories in space in these initialapplications may constitute a serious impediment to theirdevelopment." A true space station might represent "a more effectiveuse of funds." The panel endorsed building a single wet workshop, ifonly as an initial step: "The launch vehicle and spacecraft for thisexperiment are already on order, and the opportunity for 28- and56-day flights in 1968 should be taken."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In other areas, the report was more favorable:"In the period after the initial two Apollo lunar landings werecommend that a sustained program of lunar exploration... continuemanned expeditions at the rate of between one and two per year." ThePSAC recommended "that the Saturn V vehicle continue to be produced,"and that "the post-Apollo Saturn V production rate be fixed at 4systems per year."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On Voyager: "We recommend an expandedcommitment to the Voyager planetary lander program, pointing toward asoft landing of a Surveyor-type module on Mars in 1973." As a preludeto Apollo, a program called Surveyor was seeking to conduct softlandings of automated spacecraft on the moon, and had scored itsfirst success the previous June.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On a space station:</FONT></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We recommend that programs of studies   and advanced developments be initiated promptly with the objective   of a launch in the mid 1970's of the first module of a space   station for very prolonged biological studies of man, animals, and   other organisms in earth orbit.

It endorsed only a modest Apollo Applicationseffort, as noted. It ignored NERVA, though that program wasproceeding smartly with its nuclear engine and offered a promisingsource of propulsion for a piloted mission to Mars. The PSAC alsorecommended delaying a commitment to a true space station until 1971or 1972, although its advocates hoped for such a decision as early as1968. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">71</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> By endorsing construction of this station "in themid-1970's," and by openly embracing Mars as a long-term goal, thePSAC endorsed a program that went well beyond what NASA in fact wouldbe able to pursue.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While Mars was in the ascendancy at the PSAC,NASA's hopes were about to prove star-crossed. The agency had beencharging ahead with Apollo; in January 1967 it had a Saturn I-B on apad at Cape Canaveral that was being readied to launch a mission intoorbit. Late that month, the astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, andRoger Chaffee were conducting a pre-launch exercise atop that rocket,within their spacecraft. A fire broke out; the men could not escape,and they perished before help could reach them. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">72</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the aftermath of this fire, plans for thefuture went on hold while NASA struggled to win success with Apollo.There also was bad news elsewhere in Washington and in the nation. InJanuary, the President had presented the federal budget for FiscalYear 1968, anticipating a deficit of $8 billion. The Vietnam War,however, was escalating rapidly. By August, when the estimate wasclose to $30 billion, Johnson asked Congress to approve a 10 percentincome-tax surcharge to keep it from rising further.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The summer of 1967 also brought major riots.Looters in Newark plundered stores on a massive scale; snipers firedfrom rooftops, and fires blazed high. The city's 1,400 policeofficers could not control the situation. Speaking[<A NAME="101"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">101</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] of "a city in open rebellion," New Jersey's governorcalled in the National Guard. At the peak, almost half of the citywas in the hands of the rioters. The upheavals raged for five days;27 people lost their lives.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Detroit blew a week later; the next 11 dayssaw 1,600 fire alarms. Three miles of Grand River Avenue, a majorthoroughfare, burned to the ground. Some sections of downtownresembled the burned-out German cities of World War II. Forty-threepeople died; over 7,000 were arrested; 5,000 were left homeless.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">73</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Conditions have greatly changed since Isubmitted my January budget," the President admitted. "Because thetimes have placed more urgent demands upon our resources, we must nowmoderate our efforts in certain space projects." In the House, anappropriations subcommittee reopened hearings on the NASA budget, andproceeded to make deep cuts in virtually every program exceptApollo.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With cities burning, taxes rising, and theVietnam War escalating, NASA proceeded to shoot itself in the foot.In a stunning display of tactlessness, the Manned Spacecraft Centerinvited 28 companies to bid on a study of piloted flyby missions toMars and Venus, beginning in 1975. When this announcement created anuproar, MSC withdrew its request. It was too late. In Congress, theview took hold that the automated Voyager project should be canceledbecause it was the first step toward a needless extravagance: apiloted mission to Mars.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The final cut in NASA's budget came to $511million, a reduction of 10 percent. Voyager was canceled, beingeliminated in conference with the Senate. Apollo Applications,budgeted at $454 million in the January presidential request, endedwith $253 million. The conferees spared Apollo, voting funds to allowthis program to recover in the wake of the fire at Cape Canaveral.The cuts, however, hit hard at future programs. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">74</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Voyager did not remain dead for long. Withindays of its formal cancellation, NASA officials began discussing afollow-on concept that was approved by the president in the budgetfor FY 1969. The new project had the name Viking, and its missionremained the same: to orbit Mars with automated spacecraft, placelanders gently on the surface, and look for signs of[<A NAME="102"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">102</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] life. Viking, however, would not ride a Saturn V; itwould use the Titan III-Centaur. While this was certainly a splendidlaunch vehicle, it had less than one-eighth the lifting power of itsmuch larger cousin. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">75</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That summer's near-debacle confirmed Webb'sbelief that even a modest post-Apollo planning effort could backfirebadly. With Apollo continuing to reign supreme in a time of cutbacks,Webb took to raiding the Apollo Applications budget by reprogrammingsome of its funds. In June 1968, he told his center directors thatthis program was nothing more than "a surge tank for Apollo." In thisfashion, he took from the future to meet the needs of the present.Above all else, Apollo </FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">had</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> to succeed.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">76</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That program's peak funding had come in FY1965. That year also saw NASA's appropriation peak at $5.25 billion.After this, the budget slid downward; the appropriation for FY 1969,which began the previous July, was $3.953 billion, a drop of 25percent. NASA's in-house employment stayed close to the FY 1965 levelof 33,000 positions. The contractors, however, were having a hardtime of it; their personnel had fallen by half, from 377,000 to186,000. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">77</FONT></SUP></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"> Unless NASA could take hold of something new andmajor, it was likely to shrink to insignificance.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mueller had hoped that Apollo Applicationscould come to the forefront as this new program. Already in 1968, itwas clear that this would not happen. The Agency had spent severalyears trying to pursue such a route to the future, without success.More was involved here than budget cuts per se. Congress and theAdministration had imposed those cuts because NASA had failed to makea persuasive case for its plans. In addition to this, NASA was notable to propose anything as compelling as Apollo.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Apollo, above all, had the beauty ofsimplicity. Everyone knew of science-fiction visions of astronauts onthe moon. The program's goal was succinct: to carry out the lunarlanding during the decade of the 1960s, and to bring its explorersback safely. As Von Braun stated in 1964, "Everybody knows what themoon is, everybody knows what this decade is, and everybody can tella live astronaut who returned from the moon from one who didn't."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">78</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="103"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">103</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Apollo Applicationslacked this compelling character. In the end, it was a program withno clear central focus. It offered only modest initiatives: solarastronomy, flights with durations of weeks, medical studies, andopportunities to use Saturn-class rockets that otherwise might go towaste. The historian John Logsdon writes that, according to programcritics, these initiatives "were designed to fit the specificfeatures of the Apollo and Saturn hardware. The missions suggestedwere not necessarily those deserving highest priority, and modifiedApollo/Saturn equipment was not necessarily the most effective way ofcarrying out those missions." Here was enough to support a singleorbital workshop, but not enough to complete with something ashistoric as putting the first man on the Moon.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An opportunity, however, did exist to planonce again with boldness. The PSAC report had danced around this,proposing nothing more than "the expectation of eventual mannedplanetary exploration." That was not NASA's style; the agency hadestablished itself by literally reaching for the moon, not by restingcontent with an expectation that astronauts would get there someday.The new goal was there for anyone who would dare to pursue it, toseize it. One could see it in the night sky, glowing redly; one couldname this goal with a single word: Mars. During 1969, NASA would seekseriously to establish a piloted expedition to this planet as thebasis for the agency's future.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Footnotes</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">.
