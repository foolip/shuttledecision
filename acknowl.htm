<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">v</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Some projects begin
by happenstance, and in such a fashion, the present book grew out of
my commercial work, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Countdown: A
History of Space Flight</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> (John Wiley,
1997). In researching its source material, I made good use of the
NASA SP series of books - and noticed that there was a significant
gap in their coverage. The series included works on most of the
principal piloted programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab,
Apollo-Soyuz. There was nothing, however, on the Space
Shuttle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In June 1996, I visited the NASA History
Office to conduct research on an article for the magazine Air &amp;
Space. I heard someone say the name, "Roger," and quickly met the
chief historian, Roger Launius. When I asked him about the lack of
Space Shuttle coverage, he replied with a tale of woe. He had offered
this project to Professor John Logsdon of George Washington
University, who certainly would have carried it out quite capably.
However, they had been unable to agree on the terms of a contract.
Launius had approached other writers and aerospace historians as
well, again to no avail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Seeing an opportunity, I suggested that I
might write NASA's Space Shuttle book. Dr. Launius expressed interest
and later, early in July, I submitted a formal proposal. Four months
later, at the beginning of November, I was informed that I was to
receive the assignment. I learned that Dr. Launius saw this as the
first in a three-volume history of the Shuttle. The present book,
Volume I, covers events through the awarding of the principal
contracts in 1972. Volume II, presently in preparation, will treat
the technical development of the Shuttle, through the eve of its
first flight in 1981. Volume III will present the operational
Shuttle, including the first 100 flights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It is a pleasure to note the people who have
helped me in this work. Dr. Launius has been in the forefront, taking
an active interest and steering me to other archives while offering
full use of his own NASA holdings. His archivist Lee Saegesser, now
retired, gave valuable help in finding specific documents. Other
members of his staff have helped as well: Nadine Andreassen, Colin
Fries, Stephen Garber, Mark Kahn, Terese Ohnsorg, and especially
Louise Alstork, who copyedited the typescript.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The correspondence, memos, and project
documents that served as source material, exclusive of published
books, filled three suitcases. Much of this material came from other
NASA center archives, and I received valuable help from their own
staff members. At Marshall Space Flight Center, key people include
Mike Wright, Alan Grady, and Laura Ballentine. At Johnson Space
Center, I received much help from Janine Bolton and Sharon Halprin.
At Kennedy Space Center, I relied on Donna Atkins and Elaine
Liston.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force maintains an extensive archive
at Maxwell AFB, and I received good help from the librarian Ann Webb.
A security officer, Archie DiFante, worked with classified materials
and performed the highly valuable service of releasing some of their
unclassified sections to me, on the spot. At [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">vi</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] the University of
Michigan's Department of Aerospace Engineering, the librarian Kenna
Gaynor helped as well. During my days as a graduate student in that
department, early in the 1970s, I had compiled a collection of
contractors' space-shuttle documents, and had donated them to the
department library. A quarter-century later, with help from my former
professor Harm Buning, Ms. Gaynor found some of this material and
sent it on to me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I also learned much through interviews with
key individuals: J. Leland Atwood, former chairman of North American
Aviation (NAA); Robert Biggs, the corporate memory at Rocketdyne;
Paul Castenholz, the man who made the Space Shuttle Main Engine;
Maxime Faget, a principal Shuttle designer; and Dale Myers, NASA's
Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight. This list of
interviewees is somewhat limited, for a good reason: I was able to
use transcripts from NASA's own program of oral history
interviews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In providing help, Professor John Logsdon
stands in a class by himself. He personally conducted many of these
interviews, and provided me with transcripts. He wrote a book-length
monograph on the rise of the Space Shuttle. He also gave me the free
use of his own archive, which contains thousands of neatly filed and
readily accessible letters and memos. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">My thanks also go to Tammy Golbert of the
Folsom Library at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She gave me
access to the papers of George Low that are on deposit within that
library's special collections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This project has been something of a family
affair, and I note the help of my son Alex Heppenheimer, who used the
Internet to secure a valuable guide to published source material. My
former wife, Phyllis LaVietes, served as my secretary and took care
of my word processing. I note as well the contributions of the
artists Don Davis and Dan Gauthier, who provided me with
illustrations. In addition to this, much of this book's line art and
photography comes courtesy of the author Dennis Jenkins. His book
"Space Shuttle" (Walsworth Publishing Company, 1966) contains much
interior art, and he has generously made it available for use by
NASA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The NASA Headquarters Printing and Design
Office developed the layout and handled printing for this volume.
Specifically, I wish to acknowledge the work of Geoff Hoffman, Janie
Penn, Chris Pysz, and Kelly Rindfusz for their expert editorial and
design work. In addition, Stanley Artis, Michael Crnkovic, and
Jeffrey Thompson saw the book through the publication process. Thanks
are due to all of them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">vii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] With considerable
joy, I dedicate this book to my wife, the former Beverley Brownlee.
We were married in West Palm Beach, Florida, on June 8, 1998, as I
was completing the preparation of this work for the press.</FONT>
