SHUTTLE</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="245"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">245</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The Space Shuttle
effort had a full share of optimists, with one of the more noteworthy
being Francis Clauser, chairman of the college of engineering at
Caltech. As a member of the Townes panel that had reviewed the space
program, immediately following Nixon's election, he had written, "I
believe we can place men on Mars before 1980. At the same time we can
develop economical space transportation which will permit extensive
exploration of the Moon." His views of the Shuttle were similarly
hopeful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In May 1969, Clauser proposed that the coming
decade "will see the cost of space transportation reduced to the
point that the average citizen can afford a trip to the Moon." He
emphasized that "when I speak of </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">low-cost</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> space
transportation, I define low to be so low that the </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">citizenry</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> can afford to
buy tickets for space." To achieve such a goal, he put his trust in
single-stage launch vehicles burning hydrogen for high performance,
and capable of routine flight to orbit. With such craft, NASA might
undertake as many as 40,000 missions "before flight costs would begin
to absorb a major share of its minimal budget."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lockheed's Max Hunter had a similar outlook,
as he abandoned his partially-reusable Star Clipper to embrace NASA's
two-stage fully reusable configuration. Speaking at the University of
Michigan in mid-1970, he proposed that a schedule of 95 flights per
year would bring a cost per flight of some $350,000, or $7 per pound
of payload delivered to orbit. He added that Texas Instruments would
conduct manufacturing operations in space if the
[<A NAME="246"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">246</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] cost went below $50 per pound; at $5 per pound, the
Hilton family would build a hotel in orbit. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Was there any basis for such optimism? There
was a modest but significant base of experience with existing rocket
engines and with the X-15. In addition to this, experience with
commercial airliners offered a set of approaches that appeared to be
potentially useful. Other approaches reflected the work of design
engineers, who expected to meet specifications calling for low
cost.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Why People Believed in Low-Cost Space
Flight</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In October 1969, at a Space Shuttle symposium
held in Washington, George Mueller presented opening remarks:</FONT>
</P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The goal we have set for ourselves is
   the reduction of the present costs of operating in space from the
   current figure of $1,000 a pound for a payload delivered in orbit
   by the Saturn V, down to a level of somewhere between $20 and $50
   a pound. By so doing we can open up a whole new era of space
   exploration. Therefore, the challenge before this symposium and
   before all of us in the Air Force and NASA in the weeks and months
   ahead is to be sure that we can implement a system that is capable
   of doing just that.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Let me outline three areas which, in my
   view, are critical to the achievement of these objectives. One is
   the development of an engine that will provide sufficient specific
   impulse</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">2</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">
   </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">with adequate margin to propel its
   own weight and the desired payload.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">A second technical problem is the
   development of the reentry heat shield, so that we can reuse that
   heat shield time after time with minimal refurbishment and
   testing.</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The third general critical development
   area is a checkout and control system which provides autonomous
   operation by the crew without major support from the ground and
   which will allow low cost of maintenance and repair. Of the three,
   the latter may be a greater challenge than the first
   two</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="247"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">247</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At that time, when
the 50,000-pound payload was still the standard, Mueller's cost goal
represented a cost per flight of from $1 million to $2.5 million.
This would not allow ordinary citizens to buy tickets into space, and
was somewhat higher than Max Hunter's figure of $350,000. Regardless,
if realized, it would be a long leap downward from the $185 million
of a Saturn V.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 had already established itself as a
reusable and piloted rocket airplane, with performance approaching at
least that of a shuttle booster, though not of an orbiter. As program
participants developed experience, they brought the turnaround time
to as little as six working days. Individual X-15 aircraft could fly
as often as three times a month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A careful post-flight inspection followed each
mission and took about two days. Inspectors examined the aircraft
closely, looking for loose fasteners, cracks, hydraulic or propellant
leaks, and overheating. Technicians checked the engine system for
leaks using pressurized helium. The pilot reported in-flight
problems, while other problems became known through study of data
from onboard instruments. These post-flight activities guided
subsequent work of maintenance and repair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The engine received particularly close
attention. At the start of the X-15 program, an engine run was
required before each flight. In subsequent years, an engine still
required a pre-flight run after replacement or major maintenance, or
after three flights. A test pilot played an essential role during
these engine tests, sitting in the cockpit and operating the aircraft
systems. These tests disclosed such problems as rough engine
operation and faulty operation of a turbine or pump, with the source
of the problem being found and fixed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">All aircraft systems received complete tests
prior to the next flight. They also received close inspection and
overhaul at stated intervals. After every five flights, the landing
gear, which was under high stress, was x-rayed for cracks. Because
flaps were essential for a safe landing, their gear boxes were
checked for wear after every five flights as well. Stability
augmentation systems, which helped to maintain control during
reentry, were tested for alignment. An engine demanded major
maintenance after 30 minutes of operation; it thus had a long life
between overhauls, for at full thrust an X-15 would burn a complete
load of propellant in less than 90 seconds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the X-15 program, the principal maintenance
problems centered on structural repairs and on propellant and
pneumatic leaks. The latter often resulted from failures of gaskets
or O-rings. Most of the structural repair items
[<A NAME="248"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">248</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] were minor. Significantly, the hot structure of the
X-15, which absorbed the heat of reentry, did not represent an
important source of problems. Working at Edwards Air Force Base, a
ground crew of modest size successfully handled most issues of
maintenance and repair. Three X-15 aircraft thus conducted 198
powered flights between 1959 and 1968, when the program ended.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The X-15 represented one element of experience
pertinent to the Space Shuttle. Another element involved the
high-performance liquid rocket engines of the 1960s. The Space
Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) was initially planned for 100 starts and a
10-hour life, representing a twentyfold improvement over the engine
of the X-15. This long life would be essential for a low-cost
shuttle, by reducing the number of costly engine overhauls and
eliminating downtime due to engine changeouts and major maintenance.
Although the engines of the 1960s had not been designed for long life
in service, tests had shown that they already were close to achieving
the requirement for an SSME.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The RL-10, with 15,000 pounds of thrust, had
been the first to show this. As early as 1963, individual engines had
been operated for over two and a half hours, with more than 50
restarts. By 1969, the total duration for a single test engine
exceeded that of 50 shuttle missions, while a thrust chamber, sans
turbopumps, received a series of test firings that totaled more than
11 hours. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The engines of Apollo showed similar life. The
F-1 was rated for 20 starts and 2250 seconds in total duration. Yet
by replacing the liquid-oxygen pump impeller and the turbine manifold
at 3500 seconds, test engines achieved as many as 60 starts and total
durations of 5000 to 6000 seconds. The J-2 did even better, with a
test engine running for 103 starts and 6.5 hours, without
overhaul.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"We never wore out an engine of the J-2 type,"
recalls Rocketdyne's Paul Castenholz, who managed its development.
"We could run it repeatedly; there was no erosion of the chamber, no
damage to the turbine blades. If you looked at a J-2 after a hot
firing, you would not see any difference from before that firing. The
injectors always looked new; there was no erosion or corrosion on the
injectors. We had extensive numbers of tests on individual engines,"
which demonstrated their reliability. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="249"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">249</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] This experience
meant that existing engine-design practice gave a reserve of engine
life that engineers could draw on in meeting SSME goals. SSME
requirements, however, were far more demanding because it was to
operate at much higher pressures. The chamber pressures of the F-1
and J-2 were modest by later standards: 763 and 982 psi,
respectively. At full power, that of the SSME would be 3280 psi.
Preburners, which fed the main combustion chamber, were to operate at
pressures up to 5500 psi. In turn, these preburners received
propellants from the turbopumps, whose pump discharge pressures had
to be higher still: as much as 8000 psi.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The turbopumps thus would face enormous
stresses, produced not only by pressure but by extremes of
temperature. These turbopumps would be driven by hot gases and were
to pump liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen at temperatures hundreds of
degrees below zero. They had to be built as compact units - which
meant that across a distance of no more than two or three feet, a
red-hot turbine would be driving a deeply chilled pump. These
temperatures would cause the metals and materials of a turbopump to
expand and contract every time the engine was fired, and designers
had to ensure that the resulting stresses would not produce
cracks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, the turbopumps were to operate at
extraordinary power levels. The hydrogen turbopump, more powerful
than the oxygen pump, was to approach 75,000 horsepower - in a unit
the size of an outboard motor. This compared with the 55,000
horsepower that drove the liner </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">Titanic</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> early in the
century, in an era when engine rooms covered an acre of space below
decks. Moreover, its rotating turbomachinery was to spin at over
36,000 rpm. Yet while its bearings had to work without lubrication,
for the use of oils or greases was out of the question. At the hot
end of a shaft, these lubricants would evaporate. At the cold end,
they would freeze solid. Within the oxygen turbopump, exposed to
liquid oxygen, such substances would explode.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">7</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pratt &amp; Whitney built prototypes of such
pumps for both its XLR-129 and its NASA 350,000-pound engine, and
Rocketdyne expected to do likewise. To deal with thermal stresses
produced by the temperature extremes, designers were accustomed to
using high-strength ceramics that expanded and contracted less than
metals. Though hydrogen made some alloys brittle, designers
[<A NAME="250"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">250</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] could protect them with thin coatings of gold,
deposited on hot engine parts. Though this led to talk of
"gold-plated engines," gold was desirable because it would not
corrode.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were a variety of means to design
turbopumps. Conventional ball bearings were of stainless steel, but
specialized ceramics and glasses offered greater hardness and
resistance to wear. It even was possible to dispense with ball
bearings altogether and introduce hydrostatic bearings that relied on
fluid pressure to maintain a clearance between a shaft and its
housing. This avoided having parts in contact that could experience
friction and wear. While hydrostatic bearings demanded a great deal
of testing to ensure that they would operate properly, Rocketdyne's
Robert Biggs noted that when such bearings were used on the SSME,
they "worked beautifully."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although a complete SSME would have 45,000
parts, it was not necessary that all of them last for the rated
engine life between overhauls. Engineers expected to design for ease
of maintenance, by providing for ready replacement of some parts and
components. "Line-replaceable units" could be removed and reinstalled
while leaving an engine as a whole attached to its mounts. Through
these approaches - design for maintainability, design for relief of
thermal stresses, alternate means for building heavily stressed
bearings, reliance on the reserve of engine life afforded through
existing experience - engineers expected to meet the challenge of
developing an SSME with long life. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">8</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other alternatives existed in the area of
thermal protection for the booster and orbiter, to guard against the
heat of reentry. Hot structures offered a well-established but
complex and tricky approach; while tiles of matted silica fiber
promised simplicity, they were in an early stage of development in
1970. There also was a third approach: ablative heat shields of light
weight and low cost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In their earliest forms, such heat shields
dated to the missile nose cones of the mid-1950s. They had been
standard elements of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft,
showing particular merit on the latter, which returned from the moon
by re-entering the atmosphere with twice the energy of a return from
earth orbit. Ablative shields carried away the heat of reentry by
vaporizing or charring in a controlled manner; hence they were not
reusable. [<A NAME="251"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">251</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] New versions,
however, had densities as low as 15 pounds per square foot, matching
the low weight of tiles. There also was strong interest in low-cost
methods for fabrication of large ablative panels that could be
installed readily and removed while covering substantial areas of a
shuttle's wings and body. Engineers thus were confident that they
could use such panels as an interim method for thermal protection,
allowing them to get a shuttle up and flying even if development of
the tiles were to encounter delays.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to this, while the tiles were to
cover large areas, they could not cope with the reentry temperatures
of a shuttle's nose and wing leading edges, which would range from
2500 to 3500 &#176;F. For these limited regions, still another
alternative was under development: carbon composites. Carbon had an
excellent ability to withstand high temperatures; vanes of graphite,
dipping into the rocket exhaust of the V-2, had steered that missile
as far back as 1942. Being brittle, graphite was unsuitable for use
in thermal protection. The new carbon composites, however, were
resilient, and reusable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These composites drew on a recent invention:
carbon fiber, while fragile, possesses some strength." Such fibers
could be woven into cloth, with the cloth being impregnated with a
specialized resin. A contractor would pile layers of this resinous
cloth within a mold, forming a layup. Heated to high temperatures in
the absence of oxygen, the resin would pyrolize, emitting gases and
turning into carbon as well. The resulting article, treated with a
coating to resist oxidation, showed promise at temperatures up to
4000 degrees. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">9</FONT></SUP></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A strong technical background was also
emerging in the third of Mueller's critical areas, which he had
described as "a checkout and control system which provides autonomous
operation by the crew and which will allow low cost of maintenance
and repair." Mueller had outlined a basis for such a system in a May
1969 briefing to shuttle contractors. He had called for an array of
sensors and onboard computers that could diagnose the health of a
shuttle's engines and other subsystems, returning such messages as "I
am well" or "I am going to be sick."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Computerized checkout offered an important
path toward low-cost space flight. Cost meant people, and it was
taking a ground crew of 20,000 NASA and contractor employees to
prepare and launch a Saturn V with its Apollo
[<A NAME="252"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">252</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] moonship. If computers were to eliminate some of
these jobs, here was a good reason for this to happen. Computerized
checkout also promised more effective maintenance, a topic on which
people in the airline industry had a number of pointed comments.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1968, with computerized checkout still off
in the distance, two maintenance managers at American Airlines noted
"the difficulty of quickly and accurately locating a fault in our
complex airplanes. As a consequence, much of our current
troubleshooting efforts are ineffective." Many aircraft components
received an allotted time in service prior to removal for test or
overhaul; yet over 80 percent of these "time-controlled" units did
not run to their approved time limits. Regardless, it was not
desirable to reduce the time between overhauls. Experience had shown
that when items were removed for test or for major maintenance, they
tended to fail more frequently after being reinstalled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Troubleshooting, also, was hit-and-miss. We
all have had the experience of taking a car to a garage for repair,
having a mechanic replace a part, paying the bill - and finding that
the problem remains unsolved. Such experiences were also common in
the airline industry. The American Airlines managers wrote that
</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">over a recent six-month period, 44
   percent of the components replaced during maintenance of the air
   conditioning system did not eliminate the pilot's complaint.
   Fifty-two percent of the replacements in the autopilot system did
   not eliminate the pilot's complaint.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The nation's airlines thus had a particularly
strong interest in computerized checkout. While NASA was quite
prepared to develop its own system for the shuttle, the airlines and
their contractors could offer valuable experience, while subjecting
such systems to the demands of daily use in large fleets over long
periods. Pan American World Airways was emerging as an industry
leader in this area; in 1970, it was providing onboard fault
detection and analysis for cockpit instruments and items of flight
equipment. These included the radio altimeter, radio receivers used
for navigation and low-visibility landings, transponders that
returned a radar signal to make a plane show up brightly on a radar
screen, and electrical generating systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="253"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">253</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Pan Am was also
extending the use of such airborne monitoring systems to detect
faults in engines. Sensors took data on engines during flight; an
onboard computer used this data to determine solutions to equations
that calculated engine performance. It also compared the solutions to
stored values to establish trends in performance. If a trend was
unfavorable - if an engine was beginning to deteriorate - a printer
on the flight deck would prepare a message and warn the crew. In
1970, a prototype had already been flight-tested aboard a Boeing 707
and was slated for similar testing on a Boeing 747.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During that same year, those airlines became
part of the teams that conducted the principal space shuttle design
studies. North American Rockwell worked with American Airlines,
leading a team that also included General Dynamics, Honeywell, and
IBM. McDonnell Douglas linked up with Pan Am, while also bringing in
TRW and Martin Marietta. Hence, in seeking airline-style operations
for a shuttle, these teams had the counsel and experience of the
airlines themselves. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Of course, NASA was going to have to spend
money to achieve low-cost space flight, and development of the
Shuttle would not be cheap. This was worrisome, for in pushing the
frontiers of technology during the 1960s, the agency had often
encountered cost overruns. An in-house review, which Paine received
in April 1969, showed that NASA's principal automated spacecraft
programs had increased in price by more than threefold, on average,
since their initiation. The costly programs in piloted flight had
performed similarly. Gemini had gone from an initial estimate of $529
million, late in 1961, to a final expenditure of $1.283 billion.
Apollo, with a program cost estimated at $12.0 billion in mid-1963,
ballooned to $21.35 billion by the time of the first moon landing in
July 1969. That program indeed had fulfilled President Kennedy's
promise by reaching the moon during the decade of the 1960s, but only
because it had drowned its problems in money. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">What had caused these overruns? Here too, cost
meant people. Major overruns resulted when large technical staffs
drew salaries to little effect, as when projects encountered
technical stumbling blocks, forcing major redesigns. Such
difficulties brought delays and pushed up costs by wasting much of
the earlier work. Other delays stemmed from unanticipated failures,
[<A NAME="254"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">254</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] such as the Apollo fire in early 1967; this alone
accounted for much of Apollo's overrun. The Shuttle was all too
likely to encounter such issues, for it offered technical challenges
aplenty. Budget officials therefore were well aware that the cost
estimates of the day represented estimates made at the start of a
program and were subject to potentially large increases several years
down the road. Even so, low-cost space flight indeed appeared
feasible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In summary, people believed in this
feasibility because leaders such as Mueller had identified the most
promising routes to low cost: engines with high performance and long
life, reusable heat shields, and onboard checkout. Experience in
engine development, supplemented by a wealth of design alternatives
for critical technical problems, promised assurance of a good SSME.
Similar alternatives existed for thermal protection, again promising
multiple routes to low cost. Major airlines, working in partnership
with shuttle contractors, were already taking the lead in developing
onboard checkout.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, a question remained: Even if
NASA could build its Shuttle, was it in the national interest for the
agency to do this?</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Shuttle Faces
Questions</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In carrying through the increasingly detailed
studies that were to precede a major program commitment, NASA had
adopted a phased approach, which Paine described in a letter to
Congressman Teague:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first phase (Phase A) consists
   primarily of an in-house analysis and preliminary study effort to
   determine whether the proposed technical approach is feasible.
   Phase B consists of detailed studies and definition, comparative
   analyses, and preliminary design directed toward facilitating the
   choice of a single approach from among the alternate approaches
   selected through the first phase. Phase C involves detailed
   systems design with mockups and test articles to assure the
   hardware is within the state-of-the-art and that the technical
   milestone schedules and resource estimates for the next phase are
   realistic. The final phase (Phase D) covers final hardware design
   development and project operations. </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="255"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">255</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Like the
progression of a personal friendship through dating, engagement and
onward to marriage, this phased sequence carried increasing levels of
commitment at each step. The most noticeable sign of this commitment
was the budget. The Shuttle studies of 1969 had held the level of
Phase A; they had initially been funded at $300,000 for each of four
contractors. The studies of 1970 would constitute Phase B, and were
considerably more costly. The SSME alone would receive three such
studies, at Rocketdyne, Aerojet General, and Pratt &amp; Whitney,
funded at $6 million each. The Shuttle itself, as a two-stage
fully-reusable design, would be the subject of two Phase B
investigations, conducted by teams led by North American Rockwell and
by McDonnell Douglas. Their funding was initially set at $8 million
each, and subsequently raised to $10.8 million. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">15</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This increasing commitment was sure to bring
increasing scrutiny from the Budget Bureau, whose analysts were
prepared to seek justification of the Shuttle by applying a standard
economic approach. This approach relied on constant or uninflated
dollars, thus making it possible to ignore the effects of inflation.
Its point of departure lay in the indisputable fact that, during the
1970s, the Shuttle program would require substantial outlays of funds
to pay for its development. In exchange for this, the program could
hope to reap valuable savings by lowering the cost of space flight,
during the 1980s. One then could ask if would not be better and more
cost-effective to use the Titan III family instead. As an alternative
to the Shuttle, the Titan III was already in hand, and could readily
receive technical improvements that would allow it to carry heavier
payloads.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On a straight dollar-for-dollar basis, the
answer to this question clearly was "no." The Titan III was an
expendable launch vehicle, thrown away after each flight. Hence, even
a modest level of space activity would give advantage to the Shuttle,
for the continuing costs of Titan III production would quickly exceed
the one-time-only cost of shuttle development. With the Shuttle being
reusable, its cost per flight, once operational, would be minimal by
comparison.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The BoB, however, was not about to assess the
merits of the Shuttle in this straightforward way. Instead, it
insisted on the use of discounted dollars, reflecting the time value
of money. To economists, this concept reflected accepted professional
practice and was not a subject for argument. It stemmed
[<A NAME="256"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">256</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] from a simple principle: the dollar of next year is
worth less than the dollar one holds today, even without
inflation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">We apply this principle in our own personal
investments, when we purchase a certificate of deposit (CD). This CD
ties up money for years, and we will not buy the CD if it will merely
keep that money safe for that duration, returning it with no interest
earned. Similarly, we will not buy it if it only returns interest at
a ridiculously low rate such as two percent per year. We insist on a
reasonable rate such as six percent, or four percent after allowance
for inflation. That four percent represents the true rate of return,
in constant dollars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On this basis, again in constant dollars, a
ten-year CD with value at maturity of $1000 will cost $675 in money
we hold today. This is as much as to say that the sum of $1000,
payable in 10 years, has a value at present of $675. This also
illustrates that not only is tomorrow's constant dollar worth less
than today's, but that money markets act to determine how much less,
and to set the price of securities accordingly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In working with discounted dollars, the BoB
applied a discount rate, analogous to the interest rate on that CD.
The Bureau was prepared to set this rate by invoking a concept
analogous to investment risk. In securities trading, it is
commonplace to demand higher return on investments that carry greater
risk. Thus the corporate bonds of AT&amp;T, which are very safe and
highly rated, may return no more than six percent, while bonds of
riskier companies may pay over eight percent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For the BoB, the analogous concept was
national priority. Many federal programs could be viewed as
investments, laying out money in the short-term in hope of realizing
a social or economic return in the future. Programs holding high
priority - interstate highways, construction of schools and colleges
- could receive a low discount rate, analogous to the low interest
rate of bonds rated AAA. By contrast, programs of low priority
resembled speculative investments, and demanded a high discount rate.
The Bureau gave the space program a particularly low priority, and
imposed discount rates as high as 10 percent. This was as much as to
say that the Space Shuttle, viewed as an investment, was no better
than an issue of junk bonds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The BoB's analysts were prepared to compare
the Shuttle and Titan III in a variety of ways. The comparison would
depend closely on the assumed [<A NAME="257"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">257</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] level of activity,
the number of flights per year. For a given level, these analysts
could determine the discount rate at which the cost of the Shuttle,
in discounted dollars, would be low enough to save money. For a given
discount rate, such as 10 percent, the BoB could also show whether
the Shuttle indeed would be the less costly way to proceed - or
whether the Titan III would hold the advantage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such analyses, using discounted dollars, in no
way amounted to a simple comparison of shuttle development cost to
Titan III production cost. If the Shuttle would ever pay for itself,
it would do so when operational during the 1980s, using the
discounted dollars of the 1980s. Because the discount rate was high,
those dollars would have little present value at the immediate
moment, in 1970. Hence, the Shuttle would have to promise a
discounted cash flow that would be enormous indeed. Its discounted
cash savings, achievable during the 1980s and hence worth very little
in 1970, would nevertheless have to exceed the cost of development,
which NASA would incur during the 1970s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hence, in dealing with the BoB, NASA was in
the position of a corporation whose officials hoped to finance a
major development program by issuing bonds. With the program being
speculative, the bonds would feature high risk and would carry high
interest. Investors then readily might fear that the company would go
broke paying interest before it could realize the return from a
successful program. To guard against this, company executives would
have to give those investors excellent reasons to believe that the
benefits from this return, far off in the future, would be large
enough to be worth the wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If NASA had held high priority, qualifying for
a low BoB discount rate, it would have been in the position of a
solidly-managed corporation with a gilt-edged credit rating. Such a
corporation, paying low interest on its bonds, might readily carry
its indebtedness while awaiting the benefits of its new projects.
This interest rate would correspond precisely to the BoB's discount
rate, for with those benefits being discounted less heavily, they
would have greater present value and would more convincingly justify
the short-term project expense. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">16</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Thus, in August 1969, the BoB had carried
through a comparison of the Shuttle and Titan III using discounted
dollars. This analysis presented low, medium, and high scenarios for
NASA activity, respectively at 15, 20, and 25 flights per year. It
also presented low, medium, and high scenarios for Air Force....

20, and 30 flights per year. The 15-per-year rate was close to the
current DoD level; the high rate was twice this level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The analysis showed that at the lowest level
of activity, averaging 28 flights per year, the Shuttle would barely
compete with the Titan III even on a straight dollar-for-dollar
basis, without discounting. The Shuttle would save only half a
billion discounted dollars, and would break even with the Titan III
at a discount rate of only 1.5 percent. This was as if a Las Vegas
hotel and casino, a speculative venture if ever one existed, were to
try for a loan with interest at 1.5 percent. If the Shuttle had to do
this, it would not fly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="259"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">259</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Its prospects,
however, improved markedly at the highest activity level of 55
flights per year. Now the Shuttle would break even at a discount rate
of nine percent, encouragingly close to the BoB requirement that the
Shuttle justify itself at a 10 percent discount rate. True, this
projection raised the question of whether it was anything more than
blue sky and hype, for it would call for doubling the recent Air
Force activity level. Much of that activity had involved the launch
of large numbers of Corona reconnaissance satellites, which were
about to give way to the far more capable Big Bird spacecraft - with
Big Bird flying in much-reduced numbers. Nevertheless, under these
BoB ground rules, it was clear that the best way to justify a shuttle
program was to project the largest possible number of operational
flights. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">18</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Bureau's analyses carried a thoroughness
that could put a tax audit to shame. Nevertheless, its analysts would
give NASA full opportunity to argue in favor of the Shuttle, and
particularly of the two-stage fully-reusable configuration that now
was this agency's heart's desire. In doing this, the BoB would repeat
the experience of 1969. Its director, Robert Mayo, had given Paine
free rein to develop the post-Apollo plan of his dreams and even to
see it endorsed by the Space Task Group, largely without change. Then
Mayo had lowered the boom, cutting NASA's budget and putting that
plan out of reach. His colleagues now were ready to give NASA similar
leeway during the studies of 1970, amid a general awareness that
their budget axe was close at hand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Robert Lindley, an engineering director at
NASA Headquarters in Washington, held the initial responsibility for
studies of shuttle economics. Though he was well aware that the
Shuttle would have to make its living by providing low-cost space
transportation, he appreciated that even this might not be enough.
President Nixon's budget for FY 1971, which went to Congress early in
1970, provided $125 million for procurement of expendable launch
vehicles. This was 3.7 percent of the total request of $3.333 billion
and offered a useful estimate of the amount NASA might have saved
that year if it already had a shuttle. This was not an aberration.
The nuclear physicist Ralph Lapp, a Manhattan Project veteran and a
leading critic of the Shuttle, would shortly note that during the
eight years of 1964-1971, procurement of expendables had
[<A NAME="260"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">260</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] cost an average of some $130 million per year, or 2.9
percent of NASA's cumulative budgets. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA certainly was not going to justify the
Shuttle on such a basis, particularly since these minimal savings
would fall much further in present value through use of the 10
percent discount rate. It was not clear how to invent additional
savings, and some officials were willing to conjure them out of
little more than thin air. Dale Wyatt, an assistant administrator,
put his hope in the fact that just then, in early 1970, the shuttle
still held close links to the space station. He assumed that the
nation and not just NASA would need this station. He further assumed
that it would demand logistic support at the rate of a resupply
mission every two weeks. If those missions were to use conventional
expendables, including an enlarged Gemini capsule for the crews, they
would cost $1.625 billion per year. If, however, they were to use the
Shuttle, their cost would drop to $480 million. Thus, out of his
assumptions, Wyatt came up with savings of over a billion dollars per
year, more than enough to justify shuttle development.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This, however, represented a retreat toward
viewing the Shuttle once again as a vehicle for use in space station
logistics. During 1969, the Shuttle had gained considerable headway
through a different approach, which had presented it as the linchpin
of a program of automated rather than of piloted spacecraft. Lindley
saw that he could provide a more convincing justification by
extending this approach. He asserted that the Shuttle could achieve
additional cost savings not only by reducing launch costs, but by
cutting the cost of the payloads themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lindley proposed that the availability of such
inexpensive payloads could stimulate new uses for space, encouraging
satellite contractors to build more such spacecraft. The Shuttle
could thus promote the growth of its own traffic, for it would carry
not only the planned payloads of 1970 but many others besides. The
Shuttle then might repeat the experience of commercial aviation,
which had achieved vast growth by cutting the prices of its passenger
tickets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">How could the Shuttle achieve such "payload
effects?" It would do this by completely revamping standard practice
in satellite design and development. The spacecraft of 1970 faced
stringent limits on weight and volume,.... </FONT></P>

that era's launch vehicles. Because there was no way to recover a
failed satellite for study, much effort went into extensive ground
tests that could assure reliability. Quality assurance demanded
extensive documentation, to assure that engineers could use limited
data from telemetry to trace and recreate the cause of an in-flight
failure. To cope with such a failure, the project staff had to remain
on call, drawing salaries all the while. A large technical staff
would also be necessary to assure success, conducting extensive
pre-launch checkouts and then working with the spacecraft after it
reached orbit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Shuttle offered a completely different
outlook. Already its capacious payload bay was promising to ease
restrictions on weight and volume. To Lindley, this meant that the
electronics of future spacecraft might be packaged in modules mounted
in racks, having standard connections for power and
[<A NAME="262"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">262</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] data. Like the cockpit instruments of Pan Am with
their provisions for onboard fault detection, these modules would
indicate their health to the Shuttle flight crew.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Satellite checkout would occur after reaching
orbit, not on the ground. Astronauts would locate problems using the
satellite's fault detection system, removing faulty modules and
replacing them with spares. A satellite also would incorporate other
systems: solar panels, power conditioning, attitude control, and data
and telemetry. These could also receive on-orbit checkout. In
addition to this, because they would provide standard functions, they
could be built to standardized designs. They would take shape as
additional modules, listed in a catalog.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Existing practice called for new spacecraft to
have new subsystems in all these areas, designed from scratch and
meticulously tested. The use of standard subsystems, however, would
turn satellite design into an exercise in choosing and assembling
these off-the-shelf components. They would usually demand more
weight, volume, and power than custom versions, but would offer great
cost savings through their standardization. Other savings would
accrue through the Shuttle's low cost per flight. When a spacecraft
began to fail after years of service, a shuttle mission could
refurbish and restore it for a fraction of the cost of a replacement.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lindley's work received an attentive audience
at the BoB, where Mayo wrote a letter to Paine in mid-March that
called for NASA to prepare a detailed economic analysis of the
Shuttle. Mayo accepted that payload effects represented a promising
route toward justifying the Shuttle, and called on Paine to conduct a
study that would define their cost savings. He also urged NASA to
compare the merits of four alternative programs:</FONT></P>

estimates of the expected potential demand for payloads in orbit,
with the understanding that payload effects could increase this
demand. He wanted estimates of the cost of development of his four
alternatives. Finally, he requested calculation of the discount rate
for each alternative, equivalent to a rate of return. He described
this as "the discount rate which equates the annual benefits to the
annual program costs through 1990." He added in his cover letter that
"we request general use of a 10 percent discount rate"; it was up to
Paine to show that the Shuttle could achieve this.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA was to conduct the analyses in-house
while working with a BoB staff member, Earl Rhode. Though Lindley was
the man in charge, it soon became clear that he was getting in over
his head. Joseph McGolrick, a manager of advanced programs, later
recalled what happened:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lindley had this group of people from
   all over Headquarters, and he was drawing from people their
   estimates of "How much could be saved?" He was an extremely
   charming and extremely shrewd man who was getting out of this
   group of people a set of numbers for what the economics of the
   shuttle might be downstream. I mean, people would object about
   "This is not knowable, or if it is knowable, we don't have the
   information yet; we would have to do a study." But he really
   charmed them and said, "Hey, you know, let's just get an
   estimate."</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">It was obvious to me what he was doing
   was focusing, steering this group of Headquarters people into a
   totally subjective, qualitative kind of justification of the
   shuttle, without any real basis at all. And he went through about
   four or five iterations of this thing, finding out where the
   critical problems were, and finding solutions to these little
   problems. [The] problems, from their point of view, in justifying
   the shuttle. </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lindley knew that he needed more than
arm-waving. He required an assessment of payload effects by an
aerospace corporation with actual experience in building spacecraft.
He wanted "mission models," projections of the specific spacecraft,
and payloads that the shuttle might carry, and he needed such mission
models for the Air Force as well as NASA. The BoB also encouraged him
strongly to have the economic analysis - including the vital
[<A NAME="264"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">264</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] determination of discount rates - conducted by
professional economists with experience in this area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He proceeded to set up a series of studies.
For mission modeling and for payload and launch vehicle cost
estimates, he turned to the Aerospace Corp., which had strong ties to
the Air Force and was widely known as a center of expertise.
Lockheed, builder of the Corona spacecraft, took charge of work on
payload effects. For the overall economic evaluation, which these
other contracts would support, Lindley followed recommendations from
the BoB and approached the firm of Mathematica, Inc., in Princeton,
New Jersey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mathematica was the lengthened shadow of its
founder, the economist Oskar Morgenstern. Expelled from a
professorship at the University of Vienna following the Nazi
occupation in 1938, Morgenstern had taken a post at Princeton's
Institute for Advanced Study, where he proceeded to work with John
von Neumann, one of the world's leading mathematicians. Together they
developed the theory of games, which provided mathematical analysis
of situations where competitors act independently and with
conflicting interests, while influencing one another's actions. Their
book of 1944, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Theory of Games and
Economic Behavior</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, became a landmark.
In turn, its mathematical methods proved applicable not only in
business and economics but in military planning and nuclear arms
negotiations. Morgenstern set up his firm of Mathematica to pursue
such applications. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">24</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to analysis that might justify
NASA's Shuttle, BoB officials also wanted further studies of
alternate shuttle configurations. Though NASA might be ready to push
ahead at full speed with a detailed study of two-stage fully-reusable
designs, as early as February 1970, agency officials assured industry
representatives that NASA would pursue other concepts as well. These
might offer lower development cost, or reduce the outlays in the near
term.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In mid-May, NASA awarded the main Phase B
contracts to North American Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas. The
chairman of Grumman, a losing bidder, responded with a vigorous
protest. In phone calls and meetings with NASA officials, he stated
that he opposed NASA's preferred shuttle concept, that the Request
for Proposal had been faulty, and that NASA's decision was tantamount
to declaring that Grumman would have to get out of the
[<A NAME="265"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">265</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] business of piloted space flight. He also complained
that Grumman lacked strong support from the senators of New York, its
home state, and that the company's top executives lacked rapport with
their NASA counterparts. Paine's colleagues responded in kind, noting
that selection of contractors was not a popularity contest and
adding, frankly, that in its technical aspects, Grumman's proposal
had been the worst of the four received.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the same time, NASA was ready to supplement
the main Phase B contracts with additional Phase A studies of
alternatives. Grumman walked away with the largest of these, funded
at $4 million. This company had a strong background in piloted space
flight, having built the lunar module that had carried Apollo
astronauts to the moon's surface. Grumman did lack experience,
however, with large rocket stages. Its management redressed this
deficiency by teaming with Boeing, which had designed and built the
first stage of the Saturn V. This team was potentially as strong as
that of North American Rockwell or McDonnell Douglas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Grumman/Boeing alternatives included the
use of expendable propellant tanks, in the fashion of Lockheed's Star
Clipper. They also included several approaches to phased development,
whereby an initial version of the Shuttle would fly with interim
systems. Rather than use the SSME for the main engines of both
stages, a two-stage fully reusable shuttle might use a different
engine, Rocketdyne's J-2S. This was a simplified version of the
standard J-2, with its thrust increased to 265,000 pounds. Though, at
14,030 feet per second, its exhaust velocity would not match that of
the SSME, it still was 2.6 percent higher than that of the standard
J-2, representing a modest but useful increase.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A more far-reaching approach to phased
development called for the initial use of an expendable booster. This
could be a Saturn V first stage; it also might be a large new stage
using solid propellant. This approach would allow NASA to delay the
development of a reusable shuttle first stage while allowing the
stage that counted - the orbiter - to enter initial service.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">25</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two other companies also received Phase A
contracts, each worth $1 million. Lockheed was to study new versions
of Star Clipper, including a variant that might fly as a second stage
atop the reusable booster of McDonnell..... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Phase B contracts, initially totalling $34
million, reflected NASA's hope that the detailed study of vehicle and
engine designs could lead relatively quickly to award of contracts
for Phase C and D, covering mainstream design and development. NASA
would fulfill this wish for the SSME by granting its development
contract to Rocketdyne in July 1971. The agency hoped to choose a
single main contractor for the Shuttle itself soon afterward.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Under the spur of questions from the BoB,
however, NASA now would give the Shuttle an unusually close level of
scrutiny. Its economic analysis would go beyond standard cost-benefit
analysis, with its emphasis on discounted cash flows, by introducing
the new topic of payload effects. This topic, with its promise of
sweeping changes in methods of satellite development, promised to
broaden anew the significance of the Shuttle. Studies of alternative
designs would go beyond the earlier issue of reducing development
cost while accepting higher operational cost. These studies would now
include phased development, with the prospect of treating the shuttle
effort as three separate projects - booster, orbiter, SSME - that
might go forward in a sequence rather than simultaneously. The
resulting program stretchout then might allow NASA to proceed with
the Shuttle while fitting its year-to-year costs within a tight
budget ceiling.</FONT></P>

Administrator in his turn. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The BoB saw considerably more far-reaching
changes that grew out of a revamping within the Executive Branch.
Nixon had a strong interest in management and policy development; in
April 1969, he set up an advisory council to recommend changes within
the White House that could enhance its effectiveness in these areas.
During the following year, his personal experience stimulated his
desire for change. As Vice-President under Eisenhower, and now as
President, he had worked with the National Security Council (NSC),
which had dealt in an orderly fashion with contrasting
recommendations from the Pentagon, the State Department, and the
intelligence agencies. Nixon felt the lack of any similar institution
to coordinate policy in domestic affairs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In March 1970, he announced his decision. He
would set up a Domestic Council within the White House, as a
Cabinet-level counterpart of the NSC. Its membership would include
the Vice-President as well as nine Cabinet
[<A NAME="269"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">269</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] secretaries. Nixon chose his assistant John
Ehrlichman to direct it, thus giving him power on a par with that of
Henry Kissinger, the National Security Advisor and head of the
NSC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nixon also proposed to reorganize the BoB, to
strengthen an emphasis on management while enhancing its activity in
program evaluation and coordination. The BoB would also receive a new
name: the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In Nixon's words,
"The Domestic Council will be primarily concerned with what we do;
the Office of Management and Budget will be primarily concerned with
how we do it, and how well we do it."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The BoB had long since established itself as
an elite group within Washington. Its responsibilities covered the
whole of the federal budget, with its myriad of programs and
agencies. Yet the BoB staff rarely numbered more than 550, with some
350 being professionals, many with two or more college degrees. They
stayed away from the media; they were not a good source of leaks.
Veteran staffers, proud of the BOB's small size and central
responsibilities, viewed themselves as unique. They said that if an
army of Martians marched on the Capitol, while everyone would flee to
the hills, the BoB staff would stay behind and prepare for an orderly
transition in government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Robert Mayo, head of the BoB, did not stay on.
He had worn out his welcome by interceding in the shaping of the
Pentagon budget, which Nixon had sought to develop through talks with
only Henry Kissinger, the Joint Chiefs, and the Secretary of Defense.
John Ehrlichman would recall that "Nixon felt that he understood
enough of the general budget process that he didn't need Mayo. Nixon
just froze him out. And he also just plain didn't like Mayo."</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new OMB had plenty of clout. Mayo's
successor, George Shultz, had been Nixon's Secretary of Labor. After
taking over as head of the OMB, he received an office within the
White House itself. He started work on July 1, 1970, the day the OMB
formally came into existence, and quickly emerged as one of Nixon's
closest intimates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I think he has the most important position in
government," AFL-CIO president George Meany said in late August. "He
is, in my book, the executive vice president of the corporation. In
other words, he is the guy who runs the corporation from day to day.
He is without question over all the Cabinet members. They are just
department heads under him." In January 1971, </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">National Journal </FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">reported that "Shultz sees and communicates with Mr.
Nixon on official business more than any other senior White House
aide. [<A NAME="270"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">270</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Several times a day
he is summoned to the President's oval office; the two talk by phone
frequently. He regularly receives memoranda from the President with
the notation penned in the margin, "What do you think, George?'"
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For NASA, during the summer and fall of 1970,
the immediate matter at hand was the budget for FY 1972. On August 7,
Shultz sent a letter to Paine that set a target of $3.215 billion in
outlays, representing a further cut from the already much-reduced
level of FY 1971. Low responded on September 30, replying: yes, we
could meet this mark with additional cancellations, including
termination of NERVA and scrapping plans for Apollo 17. He would much
prefer, however, an outlay of $3.411 billion. "We strongly advise
against the actions that would be required to achieve the target
level," he concluded. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">30</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Subsequent exchanges with the OMB did not go
well. In late November, Low hosted a meeting at his home to discuss
what to do next. Participants included Dale Myers, head of the Office
of Manned Space Flight, and Charles Donlan, head of the Space Shuttle
program. As Low noted in a personal memo, a few days later:</FONT>
</P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We held the meeting because of our
   collective concern that the shuttle program, as now constituted
   (two-stage fully reusable vehicle), would probably cost more than
   we could afford on an annual basis in the middle of the '70s. A
   phased program, wherein we would first procure only the orbiter
   and launch it on a modified S-IC stage </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></SUP></B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> and only
   subsequently build a booster, would make more sense from the point
   of view of annual funding. It might also make more sense
   technically because we would face only one major problem at a
   time. At the same time, we could also adopt a Block I/Block II
   approach, wherein many of the "nice to have features" would be
   reserved for Block II and would not be incorporated into Block I.

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On December 7, late in the evening, Low
received a phone call from Donald Rice, an OMB assistant director.
Rice said that NASA would receive outlays of $3.206 billion, less
than Shultz's mark of four months earlier, with new
[<A NAME="271"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">271</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] obligational authority of $3.283 billion. The latter
represented the request for appropriations that Nixon would send to
Congress. Apollo 17 remained in the budget, while NERVA would survive
with support from key senators. The Shuttle, however, took a heavy
hit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Low still hoped to receive approval to proceed
with shuttle development during FY 1972. Four days later, he sent
Rice a letter proposing language for a formal statement on shuttle
policy:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The FY 1972 budget provides for

</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rice sent this letter down through channels to
Daniel Taft, an OMB staffer who worked with this issue. Taft replied
with his own letter to Rice, noting that Low was proposing that "the
Administration has approved proceeding with the space shuttle
system." Taft continued:</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>

   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We recommend that the Administration

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Taft added a draft of a letter with which Rice
replied to Low. While Rice agreed to proceed with development of the
SSME, he made no such commitment to the Shuttle itself. This had
obvious potential for an embarrassing situation wherein people would
regard a commitment to the engine as a back-door commitment to the
shuttle. The SSME therefore received the provisional name of Advanced
Space Engine, with the understanding that it might power a new
low-cost expendable launch vehicle instead. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="272"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">272</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Rice's phone call
of December 7 did not mark the end to the budget negotiations. In
Nixon's formal budget, late in January, NASA received another cut. It
now was slated for $3.271 billion in new obligational authority. The
only hopeful note was that at least this matched the $3.269 billion
appropriated for FY 1971, with no allowance for inflation. NASA,
however, was to set aside over $100 million of this to spend in
future years; its outlays were to total only $3.152 billion.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In initial discussions, NASA had sought $220
million for the Shuttle. A preliminary review at OMB had cut this to
$195 million. In a subsequent review, however, the OMB swung its
budget axe much harder, chopping the final number to $105 million, or
$100 million in budget authority. This included $35 million for
studies of the orbiter and booster along with $44 million for engine
development. The space station was still alive within the FY 1972
budget and would receive $15 million, to cover continuing studies.
While the shuttle was healthier than the station, it now would be on
hold for another year. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Administration's intention to keep NASA on
a tight leash was reemphasized as the agency received a new
Administrator, James Fletcher. Fletcher had been president of the
University of Utah. While his predecessor, James Webb, had spent much
of his career as a high-level Washington apparatchik, and while Tom
Paine had been a research manager at General Electric, James Fletcher
brought hands-on experience in aerospace development. During the
1950s, he had headed a guidance-system group at the firm of TRW when
that company had provided a technical staff that had managed the
development of the Air Force's major missiles: Atlas, Titan, Thor,
and Minuteman.</FONT></P>

leadership that had come out of the Navaho missile program at NAA:
NASA's Dale Myers, Paul Castenholz of the SSME, and Sam Hoffman who

was even more stellar, for this company's Air Force work had placed
it at the center of the nation's most important military
efforts.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Fall of the Two-Stage Fully-Reusable
Shuttle</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mayo's letter of March 18, which directed
Paine to compare the merits of four alternatives, set a date of May 1
for an interim report. With a week to spare, Lindley concluded that
economic criteria showed that the fully-reusable shuttle was best. It
would cost the most to develop, but even when using discounted
dollars, its low cost per flight would yield the largest savings. The
report ranked the other choices in order: a new low-cost expendable
booster, a partially reusable shuttle, and continued use of current
expendables. In sum, NASA's preferred design offered the greatest
advantage, but anything would be better than the expendables that
represented current practice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="275"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">275</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] This interim report
impressed officials at the OMB; it also drew favorable attention at
Mathematica. Early in July, representatives from that firm met with
counterparts from NASA and OMB. Pending further study, initial
results from Mathematica's analysis proved to agree with those of
Lindley's interim report. In mid-August, NASA sent a second report to
OMB, in which the ranking of the alternatives again was unchanged.
This new report asserted that payload effects would lead to larger
savings than reduction in launch costs. In a bold ploy to remove the
bothersome distraction of alternate designs, the report presented the
fully-reusable Shuttle as the ultimate goal. Therefore, the "hybrid
(partially reusable shuttle) has been dropped from
contention."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next nine months, from August 1970 to May
1971, were a time of preparation. NASA carried through the
negotiations with OMB that defined the budget for FY 1972, while
proceeding with arrangements for award of the SSME development
contract. The studies of 1970 went forward: Phase B for the
fully-reusable Shuttle and main engine, Phase A for alternative
designs. The economic analyses also went ahead. In turn, the OMB
strengthened its hand by bringing in an economist, John Sullivan, to
review the analysis of Mathematica. Then during May and June, a
flurry of contractor reports presented the most extensive work to
date on the Shuttle design and its economics. If NASA was to win over
the skeptics at OMB, these reports would be the key.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Designers expected to launch the Shuttle using
the Apollo facilities at Cape Canaveral. Those facilities were alive
with activity during 1971. Visitors came away with a strong
conclusion: This is not the delicate precision of a laboratory; this
is heavy industry. The centerpiece was the Vehicle Assembly Building,
one of the largest structures on the planet, with nearly eight acres
under roof and an enclosed volume of close to five million cubic
yards. It had four bays, each with a door as tall as a 45-story
office building, and each able to accommodate a complete Saturn V -

highway, with two sets of lanes divided by a median. That entire
roadway, however, would serve the crawler alone, with those divided

crawler would head for a launch pad, three miles away, and in this
fashion the Shuttle would set out for orbit at the speed of those

as two weeks.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">38</FONT></SUP></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas
both presented estimates for the development costs of their shuttles,
and for operational costs. Analysts at the Aerospace Corp. prepared
separate estimates, which fed into the economic studies of
Mathematica. These projected $9.92 billion for shuttle development
along with a cost per flight of $4.6 million. The latter number
represented "marginal cost," which would pay for one additional
shuttle flight once the system was up and flying routinely. It was
less than the cost of a Delta expendable vehicle, $5.4 million. While
a Delta could carry some 5000 pounds to orbit, the shuttle would
carry 65,000. This capacity would show a substantial increase over
the 40,000 pounds of a Saturn I-B, with this Saturn showing a cost
per flight of some $55 million. Hence, if all went well, the Shuttle
indeed would cut the cost of space flight by an order of magnitude.

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Aerospace Corp. received wish lists from
NASA, the Air Force, and from the commercial Communications Satellite
Corp., describing the payloads these agencies hoped to launch during
the years 1978-1990. It is [<A NAME="278"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">278</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] difficult to
characterize those payload lists as reflecting more than wishes, for
while these agencies had some sense of what they hoped to do during
the 1970s, the 1980s were too far off for serious attention.
Nevertheless, although NASA and the Pentagon were subject to
year-to-year funding approvals, their planners blithely proceeded to
describe what they hoped to be doing some 20 years in the
future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The ensemble of these lists defined a baseline
mission model, with each individual payload described in at least an
introductory fashion. Each payload had an estimated weight which
Aerospace Corp. analysts used as a basis for work that would compare
the Shuttle to alternatives calling for expendable launch vehicles.
Based on its weight, each payload could be assigned to a particular
rocket having a known launch cost, such as a Delta or Titan III.
These analysts also determined a cost for each payload by using "cost
estimating relationships," which drew on historical data. These
relationships gave good approximations of the actual costs of
existing spacecraft and satellites, which served as
benchmarks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In treating shuttle payloads, payload effects
were at the forefront. Lockheed selected four spacecraft, three being
satellites that together spanned a broad range of sizes and the
fourth being a Mars orbiter. Company engineers examined these
spacecraft in considerable detail, at the level of subsystems. They
then prepared a design guide for low-cost shuttle payloads, which
would emphasize minimal weight and volume constraints, modular
electronics and subsystems, and on-orbit checkout and refurbishment.
The Aerospace Corp. then used this Lockheed work to derive new
payload cost and weight estimates, redefining the entire baseline
mission model in the light of payload effects. This baseline mission
model thus called for 736 shuttle flights during 1978-1990, or some
57 flights per year. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT

to Paine in his letter of March 18, 1970. The fourth alternative, a

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Current expendables would also require funds
for research and development, to enhance their capabilities. Their
launch facilities would receive their own enhancements. Nevertheless,
even with an extraordinarily generous mission model and with
undiscounted dollars, the Shuttle would fail to pay its way - if one
considered launch costs only. The large size of the mission model
would amplify the substantial difference between recurring launch
costs of the Shuttle versus those of expendables. Still the high cost
of shuttle development and procurement, some $12.8 billion, would
swamp these savings derived from lower launch costs, to give the
current expendables a strong advantage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Payload effects promised to change this
picture dramatically. These effects promised modest but welcome
reductions in the cost of payload research and development. They also
promised savings of some 50 percent in payload recurring costs, which
represented the largest single item in all three space programs. As a
consequence, when one extended the comparisons to include payload
costs and not merely launch costs, the Shuttle-based space program
gave a projected saving of as much as $14 billion when compared to a
program based on current expendables.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A year-by-year comparison showed that the
Shuttle would operate at a strong financial disadvantage between 1971
and 1977, for it would incur its cost of development during those
years. As early as 1979, however, the Shuttle-based program would
show a billion-dollar saving in annual outlays, due to payload
effects as well as lower launch costs. That advantage would top $2
billion per year during most of the following decade.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In discounted dollars, the heavy outlays of
the 1970s would be equivalent to money borrowed at an interest rate
of 10 percent. The savings of the 1980s then would amount to
repayments of these borrowed sums, with interest plus principal.
Using discounted cash flow, however, it would not be necessary for
the Shuttle to show an advantage of $14 billion. It would suffice if
the Shuttle could break even. Its $14 billion in undiscounted savings
then would amount to the total of interest paid on the initial
borrowings. Put another way, that $14 billion would provide a
cushion, ensuring that the Shuttle would save enough discounted and
therefore less-valuable dollars [<A NAME="281"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">281</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] during the 1980s to
repay in full the more-valuable dollars that would pay for its
development during the 1970s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Mathematica, analysts led by the economist
Klaus Heiss considered a broad range of mission models. They did not
treat only the baseline model with its 736 shuttle flights, but
examined other models that called for from 500 to 900 shuttle
flights, again between 1978 and 1990. In addition to this, they
carried through two types of economic analysis. "Equal capability"
analysis, using discounted dollars, assumed that a particular mission
model represented the whole of the nation's space activity, with
shuttle and expendables launching the same payloads and therefore
having the same capability. In this view, the economic benefits of
the Shuttle would consist entirely of cost savings, due to both
launch cost reductions and to payload effects, in flying this
standard set of missions. The table, "Costs of Three Space Programs,"
gives an example of an equal-capability analysis, in undiscounted
dollars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This type of analysis could be described as
highly conservative, for it ignored the likelihood that with the
Shuttle chopping the cost of space activity, government and
commercial agencies would seek to do more in space. The second type
of economic analysis, "equal budget," addressed this issue. It took
the view that total space spending would stay the same, even with the
Shuttle bringing lower costs. Shuttle-derived cost savings then would
not represent cash returned to the United States Treasury, but
instead would pay for additional spacecraft and their Shuttle
flights. In turn, those additional missions would have economic
value, and Mathematica could estimate what this value would
be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Equal-budget analysis captured the cost
savings of the equal-capability case. It asserted, however, that the
Shuttle's economic benefits would also include the value of those
additional payloads, with the Shuttle spurring the growth of its own
traffic. This type of analysis broadened the Shuttle's economic
rationale - and increased the cost that the program could incur for
development and procurement, while still breaking even through
discounted cash flow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mathematica's equal-capability studies showed
that with the Shuttle incurring $12.8 billion in total nonrecurring
costs, it would pay for itself with 506 flights between 1978 and
1990, or 39 flights per year. The baseline mission model with its 736
flights, in turn, would support a shuttle program with nonrecurring
costs as high as $18 billion, in undiscounted dollars. Results from
equal-budget analysis were even more hopeful, showing that this
baseline.... </FONT></P>

the BoB during the Truman years, often said that "its name conceals
its function." Under Lyndon Johnson, the BoB included an Office of
Program Evaluation. Newly strengthened, its counterpart within the
OMB became the Evaluation Division, with the economist William
Niskanen as its director.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Niskanen, from the University of Chicago,
counted himself as a disciple of the economist Milton Friedman, a
leading advocate of the free market and a strong critic of government
programs. Niskanen himself went on to build a
[<A NAME="284"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">284</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] reputation as a supporter of tax cuts, heading the
libertarian Cato Institute. He did not love the Shuttle in 1971, and
his criticisms were blunt. He dismissed out of hand the Aerospace
Corp.'s mission models: "My impression is that the mission models
that NASA is projecting for the 1980s are unrealistic. They start at
a number that strains credibility and go up from there."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Mathematica report had tried to make such
models appear plausible by noting that "the 1964-1969 U.S. traffic
equivalent is represented by an annual traffic of 51 Space Shuttle
flights." This was close to the 57 flights per year of the baseline
mission model. Because a rising tide lifts all boats, NASA's flight
rates during the 1960s had been buoyed powerfully by the agency's
generous budgets. The OMB had no intention of granting such largesse
during the 1970s. In addition to this, the Air Force had flown large
numbers of Corona reconnaissance satellites, modest in size. These
were about to give way to the much larger Big Bird, which would fly
far less frequently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Niskanen also struck at the heart of NASA's
rationale for the Shuttle, as he rejected the idea that payload
effects would lead to large cost savings: "A large part of the
presumed savings come from relaxed design, repair, and refurbishment
of satellites. I was struck, however, with the fact that payload
design is so far down the road - in miniaturization, sophistication,
and reliability - that you wouldn't get manufacturers or users to go
for much relaxation." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">42</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The payload-effects concept amounted to
asserting that the Shuttle indeed would meet its cost goals,
including cost per flight as low as $4.6 million, and hence would
spark a revolution in spacecraft design. The first statement was a
speculation; the second then amounted to a speculation that rested on
a speculation. Moreover, while payload effects drew strong enthusiasm
from a coterie of supporters, this concept flew in the face of the
hard-won lessons through which engineers indeed had learned to build
reliable spacecraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Much of this experience had accumulated within
Lockheed itself, which had struggled through a dozen failures in the
Corona program, during 1959 and 1960, before finally achieving
success. "It was a most heartbreaking business," Richard Bissell, the
program manager within the CIA, would later recall. "In the case of a
[reconnaissance] satellite you fire the damn thing off and you've got
some telemetry, and you never get it back. You've got no hardware.
[<A NAME="285"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">285</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] You never see it again, and you have to infer from
telemetry what went wrong. Then you make a fix, and if it fails again
you know you've inferred wrong. In the case of Corona it went on and
on." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">43</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory had a similar
experience. This lab had developed after World War II as a center for
the Army's battlefield missiles, which did not demand particular care
in development. Failure was acceptable in test flights of such
missiles because other rounds were readily available for future
launches. During the 1950s a new director, William Pickering,
redirected the lab as it became a center of expertise in electronics.
By 1960, the Jet Propulsion Laboraatory was ready to proceed with
Ranger, a series of lunar spacecraft that would carry television
cameras to photograph the moon's surface at close range.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The program suffered three highly embarrassing
failures during 1962, all involving onboard circuitry within the
spacecraft. Pickering reshuffled his managers and ordered a standdown
that lasted over a year. It didn't work; the next Ranger failed as
well. Now the lab was really up against it and heads rolled anew, for
everyone understood that another such failure could bring
cancellation of the program. Fortunately, the next one indeed
succeeded, as did two later ones. This showed that the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory indeed had learned to build successful spacecraft.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The historian Clayton Koppes notes </FONT>
</P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">the precision engineering and quality
   assurance necessary for spacecraft which had to operate nearly
   perfectly every time. God was in the details - in spotless
   cleanliness, in thorough testing, and in ruthless follow-up to
   make sure each failure report was corrected rather than accepted
   on faith.</FONT></I>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This new culture carried over to subsequent
projects. When the Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the Mariner 4
spacecraft that flew to Mars in 1965, it became necessary to remove
an onboard instrument that had been prone to electrical arcing. Jet
Propulsion Laboratory technicians then installed a dummy instrument
of the same weight, polished to give the same reflectivity, and
engineered to use the same electric current. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">44</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="286"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">286</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Such experiences
flew in the face of the payload effects concept, which amounted to
asserting that spacecraft of the future would resemble stereo systems
assembled from components. Yet there also was excellent reason to
believe that even if the users of satellites were in a position to do
so, they would not want to pursue payload effects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On-orbit refurbishment of spacecraft
represented an important aspect of payload effects. NASA's Joseph
McGolrick noted that "the users that were contacted indicated no
interest in doing that. Usually, what you were talking about was a
satellite that was at the end of its life or was partway through its
life, and they really didn't want it back. It was, effectively,
garbage." Refurbishment on the ground was even less promising:
"you're bringing back junk and relaunching, and you've got an extra
launch in there to be paid for."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On-orbit checkout of payloads was another
important concept. It drew fire from NASA's Philip Culbertson,
Director of Advanced Manned Missions: </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We asked the communications satellite
   people if they expected to check their payloads out in low earth
   orbit. And the answer came back that they would not anticipate
   doing an extensive test of the satellites, if for no other reason
   than that would require deploying solar arrays and then retracting
   them and putting them back together again. They felt that the
   benefit from that was outweighed by the additional risks that they
   would go through in going through that additional deployment and
   retraction. </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">45</FONT></SUP></B>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Niskanen was one influential skeptic within
the OMB; another was Donald Rice. He had served as director of cost
analysis within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, at a time
when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara viewed cost-benefit analysis
as a key to successful procurement and military management. In 1972,
Rice left OMB to become president of the Rand Corp. Willis Shapley, a
senior NASA official, would later describe Rice's approach to the
Space Shuttle: "He was very much enamored of, and very capable in,
Rand-style systems analysis. And so he treated this as well he might:
as a classic case for a Rand-style study of what system to
select."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="287"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">287</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] At the OMB, between
1970 and 1972, Rice served as an assistant director. The Economics,
Science, and Technology Programs Division, which covered NASA, was
part of his purview, and he developed his own complaints about the
Mathematica study. He was not pleased that NASA had refused to allow
that study to treat alternate shuttle designs. He also would have
liked to see "a good careful scrubdown of the operating costs. That
number [$4.6 million per flight] that NASA was carrying around was
absurd." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">46</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Cost overruns represented another sticking
point. If the Shuttle did no worse than Apollo, which increased in
cost by over 75 percent between 1963 and 1969, then its expense would
leap to well over $20 billion. Mathematica itself admitted that it
was difficult to see how any plausible level of space activity would
justify such outlays. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">47</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The whole of that company's analysis thus was
open to challenge: Shuttle development costs, launch costs, mission
models, payload effects. The one point that was beyond challenge was
OMB's insistence on a 10 percent discount rate. This was bad news for
NASA officials, who had cherished the hope that if only they could
present a good justification of the Shuttle on economic grounds, OMB
would allow this program to fall into their hands like a ripe
pomegranate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Significantly, however, the OMB did not reject
the basic premise of NASA and Mathematica: that technical means
existed to build a shuttle capable of low-cost and routine access to
space. Those means - including rocket engines with long life, onboard
systems for automated checkout, and reusable thermal protection - all
appeared within reach. Rather, the OMB argued that the Shuttle would
cost too much when compared to the benefits it promised, and that
those benefits had been overstated. This argument invited a response
wherein NASA would seek shuttle designs having lower development
costs, which might win the OMB's favor. Such a strategy would carry
NASA through the months that lay ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In May 1971, in a briefing to OMB, NASA
officials stated that, as early as August, they intended to issue a
Request for Proposal covering mainstream development of a
fully-reusable shuttle. This Request for Proposal then would follow
closely the completion of the Phase B design studies, at North
American Rockwell and at McDonnell Douglas. Those studies,
complemented by work [<A NAME="288"></A></FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">288</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] at the Aerospace
Corp., were projecting peak funding requirements of as much as $2.3
billion in the mid-1970s. NASA hoped for a budget to match this.
</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">48</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though Apollo was nearing its end and Skylab
would soon pass the peak of its funding, NASA had wide-ranging
responsibilities in space flight and could not give itself over
predominately to the Shuttle. OMB was about to present NASA with a
preview of its FY 1973 budget allowances. On May 14, George Low met
with Daniel Taft, an OMB staffer who dealt with NASA. Low stated that
he viewed annual funding levels of $4.5 to $5 billion as reasonable
to expect. This would represent a marked rise from recent levels,
with $3.27 billion appropriated in FY 1971 and requested in Nixon's
budget for FY 1972. Low, however, was an optimist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Three days later, his hopes received a rude
shake. An in-house OMB analysis repeated the findings of the economic
review of August 1969: The fully-reusable shuttle would not be
cost-effective when compared with the Titan III family. NASA had done
its best, using mission models and payload effects to get the answer
it wanted in the Mathematica study. The OMB, however, was well aware
that economic analysis was certainly not a disinterested exercise
seeking demonstrable merit. It was highly political, and the OMB's
new in-house study reflected this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On that same day, May 17, Rice sent a letter
to Fletcher that rejected all hope for Low's increased budgets. Rice
would not budge from his proposed five-year NASA plan with a peak at
$3.2 billion per year. Fletcher would later recall him wanting a
budget that would "trail off to nothing, really. He didn't ever say
"nothing,' but at various times he said, "well, why don't you just
make it constant in terms of absolute dollars and let inflation take
it down.' Don Rice wouldn't give up. He wanted to do away with the
manned space program; and quite honestly, I think he probably wanted
to close down Marshall Space Flight Center." </FONT><B><SUP><FONT
FACE="Geneva">49</FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA had now taken three heavy hits in only a
year and a half. The first blow, in the fall of 1969, had come when
the BoB had cut the agency's budget request by over a billion
dollars. This had forced Tom Paine to abandon his hopes for Mars and
to fall back on the Shuttle/station. While this combined
[<A NAME="289"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">289</FONT></B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">] program survived near-death experiences in the House
and Senate during 1970, as the budget received new cuts during that
summer, Paine chose to emphasize the Shuttle while deferring the
space station for the indefinite future. Now, with Rice bringing more
bad news, Fletcher saw that even the Shuttle was about to fall, at
least as a two-stage fully-reusable design. The Shuttle concept that
could fit the budget was nowhere in sight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On May 22, George Low summarized his agency's
dilemma:</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The question, therefore, is, "is there
   a phasing of the shuttle or, alternatively, a cheaper shuttle that
   will not reach the very high expenditures in the middle of the
   decade?" In spite of the fact that I have been pushing this point
   for about six months now, we have not yet been able to come up
   with an answer. It may well be that there is no viable answer. One
   then has the choice of foregoing the shuttle altogether for the
   1970s and starting it in the 1980s. In that case and with the
   argument that manned space flight must go on, one would go back to
   something like a "big G" approach </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT
   FACE="Geneva">50</FONT></SUP></B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> and a
   cheap space station. Of course, I'm not sure whether that
   alternate approach would be any more acceptable in this period of
   time. </FONT></I><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">51</FONT></SUP></B>
