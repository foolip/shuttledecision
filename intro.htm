<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT

took shape and won support, and criticism, as part of NASA's search
for a post-Apollo future. As with the Army and Navy in World War II,
NASA had grown rapidly during the 1960s. Similarly, just as those
military services saw a sharp falloff in funding in the wake of
victory, the success of the piloted moon landings brought insistent
demands that NASA should shrink considerably. In facing those
demands, and in overcoming them to a degree, NASA established itself
as a permanent player in Washington.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In civics books, we learn that the three
branches of government include the White House, Congress, and the
Supreme Court. In making policy and in carrying it out, however, the
judiciary rarely plays a significant role. One may speak of a
tripartite government with a different set of participants: the White
House, Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Though the OMB is part of the Executive Branch and responds to the
wishes of the President, its officials have considerable leeway to
shape policy in their own right, by cutting budgets. In seeking its
post-Apollo future, NASA repeatedly had to accept such cuts, as its
senior officials struggled to win support within the White
House.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">During 1969, with Nixon newly elected and the
first astronauts setting foot on the Moon, NASA Administrator Thomas
Paine led a push for a future in space that promised to be expansive.
He aimed at nothing less than a piloted expedition to Mars, propelled
by nuclear rocket engines that were already in development. En route
to Mars, he expected to build space stations and large space bases.
Almost as an afterthought, he expected to build a space shuttle as
well, to provide low-cost flight to these orbiting facilities.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Soon after Neil Armstrong made his one small
step in the lunar Sea of Tranquillity, Paine received a cold bath in
the Sea of Reality. Nixon's budget director, Robert Mayo, chopped a
billion dollars from Paine's request. This brought an end to NASA's
hopes for a space base and for flight to Mars. It appeared possible,
however, to proceed with the space station and the Shuttle, as a
joint project. The Shuttle drew particular interest within the Air
Force, which saw it as a means to accomplish low-cost launches of
reconnaissance satellites and other military spacecraft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">x</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Congress, however,
was deeply skeptical toward the proposed shuttle/station, as both the
House and Senate came close to killing it in 1970. NASA responded to
this near-death experience by placing the station on the shelf and
bringing the Shuttle to the forefront. Its officials needed political
support that could win over doubters in Congress, and they found this
support within the Department of Defense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Air Force now found itself in a most
unusual position. Its generals had worked through the 1960s to pursue
programs that could put military astronauts in space. These programs
had faltered, with the main ones, the Dyna-Soar and the Manned
Orbiting Laboratory, being canceled in 1963 and 1969 respectively.
Yet here was NASA offering the Pentagon a piloted space shuttle, and
promising to design it to meet Air Force needs. Indeed, the Air Force
would receive the Shuttle on a silver platter, for NASA alone would
fund its development and construction. It is a measure of NASA's
desperation that it accepted the Shuttle project on those terms. The
ploy, however, worked. The Air Force gave its political support to
the Shuttle, and NASA went on to quell the opposition on Capitol
Hill.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The OMB was a tougher opponent. NASA tried to
win it over by commissioning cost-benefit studies that sought to
support the Shuttle on economic grounds. These studies, however,
merely provided more ammunition for the OMB's critics. In mid-1971,
these critics forced NASA to abandon plans for a shuttle with two
fully reusable liquid-fueled stages, and to set out on a search for a
shuttle design that would cost half as much to develop. Then, when
the resulting design exercises promised success in meeting this goal,
the OMB responded by arguing that this success showed that NASA could
do still more to cut costs. Budget officials demanded a design that
would be smaller and less costly, even though such a shuttle would
have significantly less capability than the Air Force wanted.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By shrinking the Shuttle, however, NASA won
support where it counted. Caspar Weinberger, the OMB's deputy
director, gave his endorsement late in 1971. Nixon also decided that
the nation should have a shuttle. On the eve of decision, the key
player proved to be OMB Director George Shultz. He decided that since
the shuttle was to serve the entire nation, it should have the full
capability for which NASA hoped and the Air Force demanded. Shultz's
decision reinforced Nixon's, putting an end to the OMB's continuing
demands to downsize the design. The consequence was the Space Shuttle
as we know it today.</FONT></P>
