GeorgeLow, working with his NASA associate Willis Shapley, responded byproposing a constant budget, with shuttle spending rising no higherthan a billion dollars per year. Low would later describe thisapproach as "the only one which could convince the OMB that we coulddo the shuttle and at the same time have a balanced space program."Unfortunately, this billion-dollar limit left NASA with funds tobuild an orbiter but not a booster. Could the agency find a way tobuild both?</FONT></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Orbiter: Convergence to a GoodSolution</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As early as 1969, during the initial Phase Astudies, Lockheed had taken the initiative in proposing a two-stagefully-reusable design with both stages built of aluminum and usingsilica tiles for thermal protection. While the final design for theshuttle orbiter would in fact use this approach, one must not thinkthat Lockheed was prescient. Though that company indeed was in theforefront in developing such tiles, they were items for laboratoryresearch. A design that specified their use had no more intrinsiccredibility than one that proposed to use the miracle metalsUnobtanium and Wishalloy. Nevertheless, the work at Lockheed suitedan emerging preference within the Air Force.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Late in 1969, Air Force officials stated thatthey wanted to build the orbiter using a conventional aluminumairframe, along with whatever form of[<A NAME="332"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">332</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] thermal protection would be appropriate. In contrastto strong reliance on titanium in hot structures, this preference foraluminum stemmed from an Air Force finding that the aerospaceindustry faced a shortage of the specialized machine tools needed tofabricate large structural parts from titanium alloy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within NASA and its contractors, designstudies weighed the relative merits of aluminum and titanium asprimary structural materials. The aluminum airframe promised to belighter in weight, reflecting the fact that aluminum is lighter thantitanium. It also would be less costly to build, reflecting theindustry's long experience with aluminum. By contrast, titaniumstructures promised to cost up to three times as much as theiraluminum counterparts, and would carry greater risk indevelopment.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Titanium, however, could overcome thesedisadvantages with its ability to withstand temperatures of 650&#176;F, compared with 300 degrees for aluminum. This brought aconsiderable reduction in the weight of the thermal protection, fortwo reasons. The temperature resistance of titanium would make itpossible to build the top areas of the wing and fuselage of thismetal alone, without additional thermal protection, for they would beshielded against the extreme temperatures of re-entry by the bottomof the vehicle. In addition to this, a titanium structure couldfunction as a heat sink, absorbing some heat and thereby reducing thethickness and the effectiveness of thermal protection where it wouldbe needed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Overall, the advantages of titanium promised acomplete orbiter, including thermal protection, that would weigh somefifteen percent less than a counterpart built of aluminum. With thetitanium orbiter requiring less thermal protection, it also wouldcost less to refurbish between missions. Though the higher cost andrisk of titanium would militate in favor of aluminum once NASA facedthe OMB's cost ceiling, the merits of titanium encouraged its useduring NASA's design work of 1970 and 1971. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">1</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Phase B studies represented the main lineof effort, with John Yardley directing the work at McDonnell Douglasand Bastian Hello managing the activity at North American Rockwell.Both contractors proposed fully-reusable orbiters, carrying allpropellant tankage within the fuselage.

This offered a route to lowerdevelopment cost because the orbiter could shrink in size by carryingits propellant externally. The tanks could take form as simplealuminum shells, while the orbiter would have much less volume toenclose within its hot structures, and much less surface area toprotect thermally.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="337"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">337</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Such approachesdated to the original Star-Clipper concept of 1965. They had lostfavor because the throwaway tankage would cost money, in dollars thatliterally would be thrown away. Partial reusability was attractive tothe OMB because it would cut the all-important development cost, theyear-to-year line item in the federal budget. NASA's fully-reusableapproach promised huge up-front costs in return for the vague hope oflarge savings after everyone had retired, through reduced cost perflight. The OMB insisted on smaller short-term outlays in exchangefor the prospect of a somewhat greater cost of launch, 15 years downthe road. The OMB held most of the cards.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Among the alternative shuttle designs,Lockheed was continuing to examine variants of Star-Clipper, with alifting body for its core vehicle and external tanks flanking thiscore. The new versions included a two-stage fully-reusable designthat placed the propellant tanks within the core and used a McDonnellDouglas shuttle booster as the first stage. NASA by now had littleinterest in lifting bodies, for they promised difficulty indevelopment along with high landing speeds. With the main line ofdesign activity now defined by delta-winged versions of Max Faget'stwo-stage rocket airplanes, NASA's continuing support of Lockheedamounted to telling the OMB: Since you want us to look atalternatives, here is what we have. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">5</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By contrast, Grumman began its examination ofalternative designs with no preconceived views as to how to proceed.When the work began, in mid-1970, this company started with 29configurations in three categories: two-stage fully reusable,reusable orbiter with expendable booster, and reusable orbiter withexpendable propellant tankage. Like everyone else, the Grummanmanager, Lawrence Mead, concluded that full two-stage reusabilitywould be best in the long run. His report, however, noted pointedlythat the other approaches offered promising means of reducing thepeak funding.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, during the fall of 1970, theGrumman group supplemented its NASA funds with company money, tobroaden further the range of alternatives. The most promisingmodified the basic two-stage fully-reusable approach by removing theorbiter's liquid hydrogen fuel from within its fuselage, and storingit in a pair of expendable tanks. Grumman managers presented thisconcept to officials at the Manned Spacecraft Center in[<A NAME="338"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">338</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] November 1970. Within weeks, these managers wereinstructed to concentrate their efforts on further and more detailedstudy of this expendable-tank orbiter, and to compare it with afully-reusable variant having internal tankage. This approach gainedfurther favor in March 1971, as NASA instructed McDonnell Douglas andNorth American Rockwell to develop variants of their fully-reusableconfigurations that would also place the orbiter's liquid hydrogenwithin expendable tankage. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">6</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Why was this approach so promising? Liquidhydrogen is bulky, having only one-fourteenth the density of water.Thus, although it makes up only about one-seventh of a shuttle'spropellant load by weight, with six-sevenths being liquid oxygen,liquid hydrogen accounts for nearly three-fourths of the volume.Being low in density and hence light in weight, this fuel could becarried in external tanks of similar light weight. Being bulky, itsremoval would bring a welcome reduction in the vehicle size andsurface area.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition, Grumman's approach brought auseful shrinkage in the size and weight of the complete two-stageshuttle, including the booster. In designing two-stage vehicles,standard procedures exist for choosing the best staging velocity, soas to achieve the lowest weight of the two stages together. At ahigher staging velocity, the first stage becomes excessively largeand heavy; at a lower velocity, the orbiter requires more size andweight. Ground rules set at Marshall Space Flight Center, based onsuch optimization, defined this staging velocity as being close to10,000 feet per second. For Grumman's two-stage fully-reusableconfiguration, used as a reference for purpose of comparison, it was9750 ft/sec.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the liquid hydrogen now to be carried inlightweight external tankage, a re-calculation of this optimum showedthat it would be advantageous to make these tanks larger, allowingthem to carry more of this fuel. The orbiter then would have to carrymore liquid oxygen, stored within its fuselage. This, however, wouldbe easy to accommodate. Liquid oxygen is dense, denser than water.Hence, the extra quantity would require little additional volume andwould not compromise the overall design of the orbiter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The upshot was that the optimum stagingvelocity, concomitant with the lowest overall weight, would drop toonly 7000 ft/sec. This would greatly ease the task of designing thebooster. The booster now could be considerably..... </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="339"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">339</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p339.jpg"ALT="Grumman's two-stage shuttle, which put the orbiter's liquid hydrogen in expendable tanks.

Grumman's report stated that thecompany would rely on "materials, analysis, manufacturing and testprocedures developed for the F-14 aircraft," a Navy fighter that wasjust entering service. The orbiter's thermal protection was to relyprimarily on hot structures, in the fashion of McDonnell Douglas,with carbon composite and silica tiles at the nose and leading edges.The use of external tankage cut the dry or unfueled weight of thecomplete two-stage shuttle by nearly one-third, from 1.02 millionpounds to 692,000 pounds.

An important group of explorers worked at McDonnell Douglas,where they proposed particularly large external tanks that wouldallow the orbiter to ignite its engines at liftoff, with theseengines burning all the way to orbit. Though this shuttle stillneeded a booster, its staging velocity fell even further, to 6200ft/sec. This booster's dry weight, 346,000 pounds, was onlythree-fifths that of the booster in the fully-reusable system.

As early as May 1971, Fagetprepared a set of drawings designated MSC-020 that put the hydrogenin a single tank, slung beneath the front of the vehicle. Thisconcept followed his preferences by specifying straight wings, a20,000-pound payload, and a 30 x 15-foot bay. It showed that, atleast in this respect, he was willing to change with thetimes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next step was to lengthen this singleexternal tank to allow it to carry liquid oxygen as well. This wouldreduce the size of the orbiter to a bare minimum. The tank, attachedto the orbiter's belly, would demand structural strengthening, forits store of liquid oxygen would be quite heavy. With all propellantremoved from the orbiter, that vehicle could achieve a standarddesign, independent of the tank. The tank could grow to aparticularly large size, further lowering the staging velocity of thebooster. In turn, this lower staging velocity would further reducethe size of the booster, cutting the cost of the Shuttle programanew.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first such concept, the MSC-021, cameforth during that May. Again, it featured straight wings and the samepayload weight as in the MSC-020. Though the bay now had a length of40 feet, it still was much shorter than what the Air Force wouldaccept. During that same month, Faget also proposed the MSC-023,again with all propellants for the orbiter in a single largeunderbelly tank. It featured delta wings and a full-size bay, 15 x 60feet. Here, for the first time, was the outline of a shuttle orbiterthat would actually be built.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even so, Faget was not ready to offer anuncritical embrace of delta wings and large payload bays. Though henow had an external tank that he liked and would stick with, hissubsequent designs continued to show small bays and straight or sweptwings, and sometimes both. He also examined a number of variations inthe arrangement of the orbiter's main engines. Though the MSC-023 hadonly a single such engine, in June he released the MSC-037, amountingto a variant with three engines and a 40,000-pound payload. Itmatched the final design in important respects.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The contractors quickly followed this lead, asthey launched new studies that assessed its merits. Grumman, whichinitially put only the hydrogen in external tanks, declared that anorbiter such as the MSC-037 was at least as promising. Lockheed,McDonnell Douglas and North American found that it was superior, withall three firms giving it a strong endorsement.

The initialpoints of reference lay in the Phase B booster concepts of McDonnellDouglas and North American Rockwell. Both contractors proposedvehicles somewhat larger than a Boeing 747, and weighing some fivetimes as much when fueled. The North American concept had two dozenengines: 12 SSMEs and 12 jet engines, the latter serving duringflyback to the launch site. McDonnell Douglas's booster, onlyslightly less ambitious, was to use a dozen SSMEs as well, with tenturbojets.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The North American orbiter had featured aprimary structure and skin of titanium, with tiles providing most ofthe thermal protection. The booster design was more eclectic. Itsfront section, which enclosed the crew compartment, had frames andskin of Ren&eacute; 41, a nickel-chromium alloy that contained cobaltand molybdenum. Though it was strong and oxidation-resistant, it washard to fabricate. Wings, vertical fin and canards, smallforward-mounted winglets used for control, all were of titanium. Thefuselage and its tankage were largely of aluminum.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then came the thermal protection, whichavoided the use of tiles in favor of hot structures. The designersmight have simplified matters by specifying the wide use of tiles, ason the orbiter. Tiles, however, were in their infancy and NorthAmerican had to show that it also understood the design of hotstructures. As usual, bare titanium skin sufficed for the uppersurfaces of the wings and fuselage. The underside, nose and forwardfuselage, however, were a metallurgist's delight-or nightmare. Thewing leading edges would use coated columbium. Large surface areaswould rely on the alloys Ren&eacute; 41 and Haynes 188, which wereexotic mixtures of nickel, cobalt, chromium, tungsten,and.....</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="347"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">347</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p347.htm"><IMGSRC="p347s.jpg"ALT="Thermal protection on the North American booster.

On paper, at least, the shells wouldnot come loose.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Such a design certainly was not in keepingwith the preferences of Max Faget, who always sought the mostconservative approach. It was an engineering efflorescence to matchthe economic efflorescence of the cost-benefit studies atMathematica, and was likely to raise just as many eyebrows. Moreover,it showed that the exuberance of 1969, when Tom Paine wanted to go toMars, was still alive. Much engineering experience is summed up inthe acronym KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. This is what John Yardley'sdesigners had done at McDonnell Douglas, in crafting their ownbooster concept.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One can describe it succinctly: aluminumprimary structure throughout, including wings, canards, and tail,with tiles of varying thickness to provide the thermal protection.Though metallic shingles would protect the leading edges, they wouldsee use only in the limited areas where tiles would fail to suffice.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">10</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These design exercises gave both contractorsthe opportunity to conduct detailed investigations using a range ofapproaches: hot structures, aluminum and titanium primary structures,tiles, and metallic thermal protection. Neither contractor offeredanything so simple as an aluminum orbiter protected with tiles,though McDonnell Douglas used this approach in its booster. Despitetheir complexities, however, the concepts were not obviouslyinfeasible, and some people believed they could actually bebuilt.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Along came the Grumman design studies, whichput the orbiter's liquid hydrogen in external tanks and lowered thebooster's staging velocity from 9750 to 7000 ft/sec. Boeing, whichhad built the first stage of the Saturn V, was teamed with Grummanand had responsibility for the booster. Its engineers determined thatthis reduction in velocity would bring a disproportionate reductionin the size and weight of the booster, which now would require muchless propellant. In addition to this, the lower velocity meant thatthe booster would be much closer to the launch site when it releasedthe orbiter and began its return. Being closer, it would need lessfuel for its jet engines, further reducing its size. The upshot wasthat whereas the [<A NAME="349"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">349</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] fully-reusableorbiter's booster would have a dry weight of 798,500 pounds, the neworbiter would cut this booster weight to 494,900 pounds.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Better still, the lower staging velocityvirtually eliminated the need for thermal protection. The booster nowwould need neither tiles nor exotic metals. Instead, it would use itsstructure as a heat sink, just as with the X-15. During reentry, itwould experience a sharp but brief pulse of heat, which aconventional aircraft structure could accept and absorb withoutexceeding temperature limits. Hot areas would continue to demand atitanium hot structure, which would cover some one-eighth of thebooster. The rest of this vehicle, however, would make considerableuse of aluminum.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">How could bare aluminum, without thermalprotection, serve in a shuttle booster? It was common understandingthat aluminum airframes would lose strength due to aerodynamicheating at speeds beyond Mach 2; higher speeds required titanium,with its greater temperature resistance. These principles, however,dealt with aircraft in cruise, which would face their temperaturescontinually. The Boeing booster would reenter at Mach 7. Its thermalenvironment, however, would resemble a fire that does not burn yourhand when you whisk it through quickly. Across much of the underside,the vehicle would protect itself by the simple method of using metalwith more than usual thickness, to cope with the heat. Even theseareas would be limited, with the contractors noting that "thematerial gauges [thicknesses] required for strength exceed theminimum heat sink gauges over the majority of the vehicle."</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1954, amid the early feasibility studiesthat led to the X-15, investigators found, to their pleasantsurprise, that they could follow standard aircraft design practice incrafting this research airplane. As a bonus, they also discoveredthat its metal skin, designed for strength rather than for heatresistance, nevertheless would have enough thickness to serveeffectively as a heat sink. Now, in 1971, engineers at Boeing werelearning that their booster could offer the same bonus, whileproviding the convenience of aluminum, the most familiar of metalsand the easiest to use.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When McDonnell Douglas went further,introducing an external-tank orbiter that lowered the stagingvelocity to 6200 ft/sec, its engineers designed a winged booster thatwas 82 percent aluminum heat sink. Though these[<A NAME="350"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">350</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] designers could have lowered the staging velocitystill further, by putting more propellant in the orbiter's tanks,their selected configuration brought the largest savings in theweight of thermal protection. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">12</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unfortunately, while the move to externaltankage brought a welcome reduction in peak annual funding, it tookNASA less than one-third of the distance from the $2.2 billion peakfunding of the fully-reusables to the $1 billion of the OMB. Thismove had addressed the easiest part of the problem; the rest of thesolution would prove considerably more elusive.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next step came during June 1971, as thenew NASA Administrator, James Fletcher, embraced what his agency hadpreviously rejected: a phased approach to shuttle development. Thiscalled for the extensive use of interim systems that would make itpossible to build and fly an initial shuttle orbiter, withdevelopment of the final systems being delayed for several years.Such an approach would be wasteful, for the interim arrangementswould cost money and yet would serve merely as a stopgap. Phaseddevelopment also carried political risks, for in Washington, fewthings are so permanent as a temporary solution. If NASA could getany kind of shuttle into space, even one of interim design, it mightface strong opposition and long delays before it could win permissionto build the Shuttle it truly wanted. A phased approach, however,would spread the program over a term of years, reducing theall-important peak funding level.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fletcher had formally taken over his office onMay 1. On June 16, in his first major decision, he made anannouncement:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The preferred configuration which is   emerging from these studies is a two-stage delta wing reusable   system in which the orbiter has external tanks that can be   jettisoned.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although our studies to date have   mostly been based on a concurrent approach in which development   and testing of both the orbiter and booster stages would proceed   at the same time, we have been studying in parallel, the idea of   sequencing the development, test and verification of critical new   technology features of the system. We now believe a "phased   approach" is feasible and may offer significant   advantages.</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">13</FONT></SUP></B></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="351"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">351</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The SSMErepresented a potentially important element of this approach. It hadbeen slated to receive early attention and funding, for it was topower both Shuttle stages. Its development therefore would pace theentire program. An alternative engine did exist: Rocketdyne's J-2Swas an uprated variant of the J-2 engine used in Apollo. It wouldlack the performance of the SSME, while delivering considerably lessthrust. A cluster of these engines nevertheless would push a shuttleorbiter into space, though with a greatly reduced payload weight.Also, use of the J-2S would permit a delay (potentially a long one)in proceeding with the SSME. Indeed, Max Faget was alreadyincorporating the J-2S in a number of his orbiter designs.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">14</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Most of the cuts in peak funding, however,would come by putting off plans to develop a fully-reusable booster,even one of smaller size and simplified design such as one of the newheat-sink versions. NASA instead would fly its orbiter atop anexisting rocket stage such as the S-IC, the first stage of the SaturnV. By delaying development of a fully-reusable booster for threeyears, the agency could cut the peak funding to $1.3 billion peryear. This would represent a reduction of nearly a billion dollarsfrom the proposed peak funding levels of the Phase B studies, andwould put NASA within hailing distance of the OMB requirement.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">While the move to external orbiter tankagerepresented ingenuity, Fletcher's decision amounted to desperation.Dale Myers, the Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight,admitted to </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">AviationWeek</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> that phased development mightprove to be impractical. Fletcher himself wrote a letter to a leadingshuttle critic, the space scientist James Van Allen: "The politicalcards are so heavily stacked against this program...that noopposition from the scientific community is necessary. I think youare shooting at a dead horse." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">15</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, the prospect of an interimbooster spurred hope among the contractors that had products ready tooffer. Boeing's situation now was advantageous, for that company'sS-IC was the only immediately-available stage with the power to carrya full-size shuttle orbiter. For Boeing, NASA's new interest in thatstage also represented a reversal of fortune. Only a few monthsearlier, the firm was looking ahead to an imminent shutdown ofits.....</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="352"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">352</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p352.jpg"ALT="Fully-reusable shuttle orbiter with the S-IC used as an interim first stage.

Now it couldcherish the hope that production of this rocket stage might continueafter all.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Martin Marietta was also in the picture. Thisfirm had actively promoted the Titan III-M, in an era when NASA hadbeen willing to consider a small shuttle orbiter that would amount toan enlarged Dyna-Soar. Though the company had done little ofsignificance for the Shuttle after 1969, now, in mid-1971, it cameforward with a new concept, the Titan III-L ("large"). This would usea new liquid-fueled core with a diameter of 16 feet, compared to 10feet for the standard Titan III, and with up to six solid-fuelboosters of 120-inch diameter.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">David LeVine, Martin's vice-president forlaunch vehicles, noted that the solid boosters were already inproduction at United Technology Corp., and could readily belengthened to yield more thrust. Though the core would be[<A NAME="353"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">353</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] new, it too would use existing engines from AerojetGeneral. Though the Titan III-L would be expendable, it would cost nomore than $30 million per launch, compared to $73 million for theS-IC. The Shuttle orbiter riding atop the new Titan would certainlynot resemble Dyna-Soar; it would be a full-size orbiter, carrying upto 65,000 pounds of payload. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">16</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The principal builders of solid rocketmotors-Thiokol, Aerojet, United Technology, Lockheed PropulsionCo.-were prepared to make a pitch for their own units as well,arguing that suitable clusters could also provide a good interimshuttle booster. A few years earlier, these firms had built andtest-fired rockets with diameters of 156 and even 260 inches. Thistechnology had subsequently been set aside as having no immediateapplication. Now, however, with the Shuttle needing an interimbooster, these big solid motors might see their day.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A fourth approach came from NASA-Marshall: thepressure-fed expendable booster. It amounted to reinventing theliquid-fueled rocket, using approaches selected for their simplicity.Conventional rocket stages used structures of thin-gauge aluminumthat saved weight. Their engines relied on turbopumps that pumped thepropellants to high pressures, with the engines operating underinternal pressures that were similarly high. Such engines offeredgood performance and strong thrust from compact and lightweightunits. The turbopumps, however, were costly and difficult to develop,and at times were prone to failure.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Marshall's new concept did away with theturbopumps, relying on gas pressure within the propellant tanks topush the fuel and oxidizer into the engines. Though these engineswould have to be of new design, their lack of turbopumps wouldgreatly ease the problem of development. They would be larger andheavier than their pump-fed counterparts and would give lessperformance. Moreover, the booster would gain weight, for it wouldrequire heavy thick-walled tanks to contain the pressure. Though thisapproach was inelegant, flying in the face of the quest for highperformance that marked the SSME, it offered one more route towardreducing the peak annual funding. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">17</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This plethora of possibilities reflected theuse of external orbiter tankage, which reduced the staging velocityand made it easier for a booster to do its..... </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="354"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">354</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p354.htm"><IMGSRC="p354s.jpg"ALT="Recoverable pressure-fed booster.

Grumman also foundlittle reason to prefer any of them-but noted that within an interimprogram of 30 flights or fewer, the S-IC, built by its partnerBoeing, would offer lower costs because it was already in hand andwould not demand up-front spending for development.

Such dumbness seemed, however, to promise a new path towisdom.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A more elegant reusable booster concept camefrom Boeing, which proposed to remodel its S-IC by turning it into abig airplane. It would receive wings, a tail, a nose with a flightdeck, and 10 jet engines for the return to its launch site. Thoughthe standard S-IC had never been built for reentry and reuse, thermalprotection would not be a problem; modest thickenings of its aluminumskin now would provide heat sink. To emphasize its short-termfeasibility, Boeing's technical artists presented top and side viewsin lavish detail, even specifying the location of the onboard powerunits and the choice of tires for the landing gear. At a time whenNASA still expected to defer building a flyback booster for severalyears, one member of the study team emphasized that "our proposal</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">is</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> thereusable booster."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By late September, NASA was ready to abandonphased development, returning to the original plan of simultaneouslybuilding the booster and orbiter. The booster would be either thewinged S-IC that used standard F-1 engines, or the Big Dumb Boosterwith pressure-fed propulsion. In turn, the orbiter would use phasedtechnology. It would have a full-size payload bay, but would use fourJ-2S engines; the SSME program would go on the shelf. For thermalprotection, the orbiter would rely on an ablative heat shield, eventhough this would demand costly replacement after every flight. Intime, however, the SSME could be resurrected for use in an upgradedorbiter. This orbiter would also use tiles or hot structures, asreusable and low-cost thermal protection.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The development costs and peak annual fundingfor the complete Shuttle, in billions of dollars, now looked highlyencouraging: </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">19</FONT></SUP></B></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0>   <TR>      <TD ROWSPAN=2 WIDTH=134>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=166>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Pressure-Fed Reusable</FONT>         </CENTER>      </TD><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=151>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Winged S-IC</FONT></CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR><TD WIDTH=96>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Development</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=70>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Peak</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=93>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Development</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=58>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Peak</FONT></CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=5 WIDTH=451>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=134>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Grumman</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=96>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">$ 4.08</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=70>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">$ 1.02</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=93>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">$ 4.5</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=58>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">$ 1.11</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=134>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">North American</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=96>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5.12</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=70>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">0.94</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=93>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5.79</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=58>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">1.21</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=134>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">McDonnell Douglas</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=96>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">5.16</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=70>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">0.81</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=93>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">7.51</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=58>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">1.30</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=134>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lockheed</FONT>      </TD><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=166>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">(Not given)</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=93>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">4.41</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=58>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">0.99</FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="357"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">357</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] These costscompared with estimates prepared by the Aerospace Corp. for atwo-stage fully-reusable shuttle: development, $9.92 billion, with apeak of $2.34 billion.</FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">20</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Thepressure-fed booster yielded a development cost less than half thatvalue, with a peak comfortably under the OMB ceiling of $1 billion.The winged S-IC was only slightly more costly, and it preserved allthe operational advantages of the fully-reusable boosters of Phase B,on which NASA had placed so much hope.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new booster concepts did even more, forthey addressed major technical deficiencies of the Phase B boosters.Thermal protection had appeared particularly difficult, at a timewhen tiles were too new to trust.

And then as we looked at the development   problems, they became pretty expensive.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">We learned also that the metallic heat   shield, of which the wings were to be made, was by no means ready   for use. The slightest scratch and you are in trouble. It became   increasingly evident that you want to have the cheapest possible   configuration, but you put all this time and effort on a vehicle,   the biggest part of which (the first stage), its only role was to   get the orbiter up high enough for it to fly itself. So here   you're spending all this effort on a part of the system that had   no basic payoff. The important thing is the orbiter-that is the   payoff.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">So you see, it was easy to say, "Why do   we break our necks putting twelve engines in this damn big   reusable booster?

By comparison, the simplicity of aluminum heat sink wasoverwhelming. It was as much as to say that instead of attempting toleap with one swoop into the metallurgy and launch vehicle design ofthe twenty-first century, engineers instead could build the boosterusing design methods that dated to World War II.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Phase B work had also pointed to demandingissues of safety. To reduce weight to a minimum, the internal tankshad to carry part of the Shuttle's weights and loads. The resultingstresses would tend to produce leaks. Hydrogen leaks are difficult todetect, raising the prospect that hydrogen could build up beneath theskin of an orbiter, to produce a damaging fire or explosion. Externaltankage solved this problem, at least for the orbiter. A leak ofpropellant now might indeed be detected, since it would occur inplain view. The leak would also be far less dangerous, for thepropellant would waft away on the winds rather than build up to forma dangerous concentration.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Phase B shuttles also promised severedifficulty in technical development. Airplanes and spacecraft, as arule, tend to gain weight in the course of development. A two-stageshuttle could accommodate such weight growth by enlarging the tanks,to allow them to carry more propellant. With the tankage beinginternal in both stages, this would demand extensive redesign of oneor both stages-which would introduce opportunities for further weightgrowth. External tankage addressed this problem as well. A simplelengthening of the tanks would do, leaving both booster and orbiteruntouched. </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It thus appeared that in mere months, NASA hadscored an impressive coup, addressing these technical issues whilesimultaneously meeting the OMB's cost limits. As with the Mathematicastudy, however, OMB officials again found reason aplenty to view thiswork with skepticism.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new configurations closely suited NASA'sinstitutional arrangements, which dated to the time of Apollo. Thosearrangements had given NASA-Marshall responsibility for the Saturnlaunch vehicles and their engines, with[<A NAME="359"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">359</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] the Manned Spacecraft Center holding responsibilityfor the Apollo moonship, with its piloted spacecraft and lunarlander. This division of authority had carried over to the Shuttle,with Marshall in charge of the booster and MSC dealing with theorbiter. The Shuttle certainly needed an orbiter; hence MSC'sprospects were clear. It was less obvious, however, that the Shuttleneeded a booster, particularly if it was to be complex and costly. AtMathematica, Klaus Heiss had managed the Shuttle studies and now wasrecommending simplified designs within NASA. He met resistance, andas he told the </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">NationalJournal</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, "For a long time some peopleover there kept seriously telling us, 'We can't go that route,because we've got to have something for the Marshall Space Center aswell as something for the Houston Space Center.'"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA-Marshall had taken shape as thelengthened shadow of Wernher von Braun, its founder and longtimedirector. He and his fellow veterans of the wartime V-2 effort, whostill held senior positions, had long since nailed their flag to themast of liquid-fuel rocketry, and had left the development of largesolid rockets to the Air Force. The recent Shuttle studies reflectedthis strong Marshall preference. Thus, early in September, theprospect had emerged that the Shuttle might use a cluster of 156-inchsolids as its booster. Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas had both madeoutright selections of this choice, while North American and Grummanhad found no reason to reject it.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA thus had a clear opportunity to seek aphased-development program with these solids as the interim booster.Instead, in a directive dated September 12, NASA had instructed itscontractors to set aside their studies of phased development and toreturn to assessments of concurrent development, using two newreusable booster concepts: the pressure-fed and the winged S-IC. Bothhad NASA-Marshall written all over them. Of course, Marshall was theworld's leading center for rocket development; its voice wouldcertainly be heard. NASA's decision, however, had amounted to aperemptory dismissal of solids. The results of the new studies were alittle too good to be true. </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">23</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The winged S-IC, for one, promised thefully-reusable booster of NASA's hopes. Its shuttle would do nearlyeverything that the Phase B fully reusables were to accomplish, witha billion dollars less in peak annual funding. Yet[<A NAME="360"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">360</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] because this booster was to grow out of the standardS-IC and would use the F-1 engine, it would continue to demand workaplenty from both Marshall and its contractors. The budget analystsat OMB had been trained to spot flim-flam. They had reason for doubtwhen they saw that in an astonishingly brief time, NASA had succeededin devising a new shuttle design with a flyback booster that wouldmake the agency's wishes come true-while still purporting to meet thecost goals of the OMB.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Projected cost savings also raised questions,for they seemed disproportionately large when contrasted with therelatively modest engineering changes that had led to the shuttlewith the winged S-IC. Were the Phase B cost estimates valid? Theywere certainly high, and if NASA could receive largesse on such ascale, it could continue to maintain itself in the style to which ithad become accustomed. On the other hand, one could equally questionthe low estimates of the recent exercises. Lockheed's invitedparticular scrutiny, for it was the lowest-and its peak level,interestingly, was just a hair under the OMB mark of $1 billion.Everyone knew that Lockheed had won the C-5A contract with anunrealistically low bid; everyone also knew that the man who hadpresided over that bid, Dan Haughton, was now the firm's chairman.Was Lockheed attempting again to buy in? Were the other contractorsvery far behind?</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even if one cared to accept everyone's costestimates as reflecting good faith, the trend of these estimatesinvited further questions. On its face, this trend meant that in onlysix months, NASA had cut the planned cost of development in half,from $10 billion to $5 billion, while sacrificing little in theShuttle's capability. These cuts had been won at a price, for thecost per flight was now on the rise-while still remaining low enough,at least in the published estimates, to make the Shuttle attractiveto users. Still, it was appropriate to ask if NASA had any otherrabbits it might pull from a hat. Thus, late in November two OMBstaff members, Daniel Taft and the economist John Sullivan, sent amemo to Donald Rice, an OMB assistant director:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the light of the innovative Shuttle   designs which have been forthcoming over the past several months,   we believe that the best procedure would be to provide NASA with a   constraint in terms of total investment cost (say, $3-4 B) rather   than have us try to define a preferred configuration.

He reporteddirectly to the OMB deputy director, Caspar Weinberger. He, too, hadnoted that NASA's recent exercises in redesign had brought theShuttle very close to what NASA had wanted originally. Four yearslater, he noted particularly that NASA's basic assumptions had seemedto be set in concrete:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">I guess what sticks in my mind more   than anything else about it was the difficulty of getting any   solid attention paid to alternative designs. I don't mean   alternative in the technical detail sense, but alternative in   terms of mission requirements and why that mattered. How hard it   was to get an examination of alternative specifications of what   you would like to accomplish, and the systems designs that   reasonably derived from that will lead to each different   specification of what you wanted to do.</FONT></I></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Rice added that within the Pentagon, "they doa hell of a lot better job of looking through the alternatives beforethey head down one of those roads." </FONT><B><SUP><FONTFACE="Geneva">25</FONT></SUP></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even so, there had been change within theShuttle program, at least in terms of its engineering design. Thetwo-stage fully reusables were dead, and Charles Donlan would notmiss them, later declaring, "It wasn't till the phase B's came alongand we had a hard look at the reality of what we meant by fullyreusable that we shook our heads saying, 'No way you're going tobuild this thing in this century.'

This round would resurrect the solid-propellant booster,and would determine the shape of the Shuttle in the form that wouldactually be built.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="362"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">362</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><B><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">End Game in the Shuttle Debate</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the internal debates of the ExecutiveBranch, the end game, during the second half of 1971, had much incommon with the opening gambits of early 1969.

Now, twoand a half years later, a similar review would introduce a conceptfor a mini-shuttle that would win support from NASA's critics-andthat this agency could not accept.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Congress was not a significant player withinthese debates, as it remained generally supportive.

Nixon's first scienceadvisor, Lee DuBridge, had retired in August 1970, citing his wish tostep down "well in advance of my 70th birthday in 1971." Hissuccessor, Edward David, had been executive director ofcommunications research at Bell Labs. David inherited the existingstaff of the Office of Science and Technology. Within this staff,Russell Drew soon proposed that a new PSAC panel should review theShuttle's prospects and offer views on how NASA should proceed.Daniel Taft, an OMB staffer with responsibility for the NASA budget,warmly endorsed this review and urged his management to support it aswell.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="363"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">363</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The resulting paneltook shape in mid-1971, with its chairman being Alexander Flax,president of the Institute for Defense Analyses, a Pentagon thinktank.

The first meeting of thisFlax Committee was a three-day affair in mid-August, far from theheat and humidity of Washington, at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, withMartha's Vineyard visible across the ocean. The group proceeded tomeet about once a month, holding discussions with NASA officials andShuttle contractors.

Amonth later, in mid-July, Daniel Taft drafted a letter of reply forDon Rice, which asked NASA to "identify an orbiter with minimumperformance characteristics." These would include low crossrange,along with substantial reductions in payload size and weight. Rice'sletter urged Fletcher to place emphasis on "defining approaches whichwill substantially reduce the overall investment cost" of theShuttle, citing a number of design approaches that would cover "thefull range of alternatives." Rice, however, did not have to cite apreferred configuration that the OMB would support.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On August 2 the OMB deputy director, CasparWeinberger, sent a letter to Fletcher that set forth budgetaryceilings for use in preparation of NASA's budget request for FY 1973,which was due at the end of September:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The planning ceilings established for   your agency for the 1973 budget are:</FONT></I></DL><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=155>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=95>         <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">(in millions)</FONT>         </CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=250>         <P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">.</FONT>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH=155>         <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Net budget authority</FONT>      </TD><TD WIDTH=95>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Geneva">$2,835</FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The above figures provide the basis for   developing your 1973 budget submission.

Fletcher stated, "My minimum recommended programrequires budgetary authority of $3,385 million and outlays of $3,225million for FY 1973." He placed the Space Shuttle at the top of hisagenda, and asked for funding of $228 million: $200 million forresearch and development, and $28 million for facilities.

Within the FlaxCommittee, reviewing the Shuttle program on behalf of the WhiteHouse, a member named Eugene Fubini had taken a leading role. He hadbeen the Pentagon's deputy director of research and engineering, andhe had willingly met with the same officials of Martin Marietta whohad been recommending the Titan III-L and its glider in lieu of atrue Space Shuttle.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Influenced by Fubini, Flax sent an interimreport to Edward David on October 19. This report presented a set ofalternatives in which the glider, far from ranking lower than theleast acceptable form of piloted space vehicle, was actually the mostambitious option that the Flax Committee was willing to endorse.Moreover, the committee's glider would carry only 10,000 pounds[<A NAME="370"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">370</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] of payload, one-third as much as the versionhesitantly considered by NASA's George Low.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">What could be less ambitious than this glider?There was the possibility of modifying Apollo spacecraft to make themrefurbishable and continuing to fly them using the existing SaturnI-B, on rare occasions. Another option called for developing theTitan III-M and its Big Gemini, a variant of this existing spacecraftthat would grow to carry as many as nine people. Such alternativesmight keep piloted space flight alive-but it would resemble a patienton life support.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Flax's report also addressed the subject ofshuttle economics. He dealt specifically with NASA's preferredconcept, which called for concurrent development of booster andorbiter, with the orbiter using phased technology. People describedthis orbiter as "Mark I/Mark II," referring to an initial versionthat would later be upgraded with SSME engines, reusable thermalprotection, and advanced onboard electronics.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's estimated cost per flight was $9.0million for Mark I, falling to $5.5 million for the improved Mark II.Significantly, and like the OMB, Flax did not challenge theseestimates. He merely denied that they promised advantage.

Similar uncertainties must be considered to apply to   other non-recurring costs such as production and facilities   (amounting to about $4 billion). Thus a possible cost uncertainty   of about $5 billion for total program costs might be envisioned   giving a high estimate of total non-recurring cost of about $15   billion.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">At a launch rate of about 40 per year   (DOD, NASA and other) over the 13 years used in the NASA cost   model and an average payload cost of $30</FONT></I><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> [<A NAME="371"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">371</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT><I><FONT   FACE="Geneva">million (not unrepresentative of the mix of current   unmanned payloads), the total payload costs would be $15.5   billion. Thus, even if the total payload cost were saved   (including those launched to Mars, Venus, etc.) over a 13-year   period by recovery and reuse at zero refurbishment cost, it would,   in the case of the high-end cost estimate, barely offset the cost   of the shuttle program without discounting. A more realistic   (although probably generous) estimate of the savings possible   through payload recovery might be 50 percent of payload costs   which could account for only $7.5 billion.</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I>      <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The other area of savings which is   offered by the shuttle is its launch cost.

Thus, with current   expendable boosters, the annual launch cost will be $500 million.   The cost of Mk II shuttle operation per flight is usually cited at   $5.5 million; thus the cost for 40 flights per year will be $220   million.

This was because this analysis used current orundiscounted dollars. The Mathematica study had moved heaven andearth to try to justify the Shuttle in dollars discounted at tenpercent per year, and members of the Flax Committee had little usefor that study's findings. In the words of a committee staff member,"No one believed all the fancy economics and no one believed themission model. I think they were on[<A NAME="372"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">372</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] hemp when they were talking about sixty flights peryear." Yet it had seemed easy to show that the Shuttle could becost-effective in undiscounted money.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now, however, Flax was saying that the Shuttlewould fail this test as well. NASA might have moved mountains to tryto cut the Shuttle's cost of development, but the completenonrecurring cost, taking account of a plausible overrun, couldeasily approach $15 billion. The undiscounted savings, with areasonable mission model and an optimistic cost per flight, wouldbarely top $11 billion and could be less. The OMB economist JohnSullivan, who had made Shuttle studies his specialty, summarized thematter within a memo to Don Rice:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A Shuttle cannot be justified when usingcost-effectiveness as the criterion.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nevertheless, no one wanted to shut down thepiloted-flight effort.

He   indicated, however, that he understood that only the level of   manned space flight was in question and not whether to have a   manned space flight program at all.

Yet acomparison of such alternatives, on[<A NAME="373"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">373</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] economic grounds, promised insights that even theFlax Committee was willing to pursue. Flax's interim report statedthat while direct cost-benefit analysis lacked "sufficientcredibility to serve as a primary basis for deciding to undertakesuch an expensive and high-risk program," economic comparisons "areundoubtedly extremely valuable in making cost tradeoffs and inconsidering alternatives in design and program planning."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In studying such alternatives, designerstraded reduction in development cost against an increase in cost perflight. This tradeoff had to stay within bounds; if the cost perflight was too high, the Shuttle would fail to capture traffic fromexisting expendables. Yet the Mark I orbiter, as discussed in Flax'sreport, would cost $9 million per flight, comfortably under the $12million of expendables. This was enough of a margin to give thisdesign a strong advantage.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Klaus Heiss, who was continuing to direct theMathematica studies, was not in a position to introduce new designconcepts of his own. Instead he proceeded by receiving thecontractors' concepts, comparing them using methods of economics. Ashe pursued such comparisons, he concluded that NASA had not pushedits tradeoffs far enough. The opportunity existed to push the costper flight as high as $10 million, in exchange for a furtherreduction in development cost and in peak annual funding. Even at $10million per flight, all but five percent of the Shuttle's plannedmissions would remain cost-effective when compared with similarmissions using expendable launch vehicles.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Heiss saw that a specific class of Shuttledesigns would do this. He called this class TAOS (Thrust AssistedOrbiter Shuttle). It would use a standard orbiter, possibly of theMark I/Mark II type, with an external tank large enough to permit theorbiter's engines to operate with "parallel staging," burning fromliftoff to orbit. Two booster rockets would flank this tank, givingadded thrust after liftoff, then falling away at staging velocity.The boosters might use pressure-fed liquid-fuel engines. Alternately,they could use solid propellant.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"If you could go to $10 million," Heiss latertold </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">National Journal</FONT></I><FONTFACE="Geneva">, "then some kind of thrust-assisted orbiter shuttlebeat out all other systems.

NASA still was pinning its hopes on apiloted booster, quite possibly the winged S-IC, and its officialspaid little heed to Heiss's proposals. Heiss knew why: "In the firstplace, there was the irresistible urge to go for the most advanceddesign and technology possible. And then there was a deep-seatedbureaucratic bias for two manned vehicles." There also were theinstitutional prerogatives of NASA-Marshall, which might acceptpressure-fed liquid boosters in a pinch, but had little background insolids. The OMB's Don Rice would note that NASA "pushed so hard forthe liquid fuel thing in the first place, because it was hard to findsomething for Marshall to do.

Lindley hadcarried out initial cost-benefit studies of the Shuttle, as anin-house NASA effort, and had worked closely with Heiss whenMathematica pursued its subsequent efforts. Heiss would describeLindley as "one of the few people over there to grasp clearly thereal economic and design tradeoffs."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Through September and October, Heiss andLindley exhorted McDonnell Douglas and Grumman to include TAOSdesigns in their presentations to NASA. Says Heiss, however, "someNASA officials kept telling them to forget it, the configuration hadno chance."

Its designconcepts were already part of the mix of alternatives; they hadmerely been languishing for want of attention. TAOS, however, provedhighly useful as it provided a fallback concept, less costly than thewinged S-IC, which NASA would adopt as it continued to yield topressure from the OMB.</FONT></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></B></P><P><B><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">A Time to Decide</FONT></I></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For NASA, it was time to have the OMB fish orcut bait. Fletcher had submitted his budget request on September 30,with a line item of $228 million to initiate Shuttle development.This NASA request was one of many budget proposals from federalagencies and cabinet departments; the OMB would modify them and thenassemble them into the President's budget, which would go to Congressearly in 1972. An early milestone in this budget process, theDirector's Review, included a session titled "Space and GeneralResearch." Weinberger ran those reviews in 1971. They representedmeetings at which OMB staff would recommend actions on agencies'requests, with Weinberger being free to respond. Following standardrules, NASA officials would not be present.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">OMB staff members were well prepared for thissession. A staff paper, prepared in early October, admitted that theuse of a single pressure-fed booster would be more cost-effectivethan use of the winged S-IC. This represented a response to NASA'sbooster alternatives of September; the pressure-fed option was arocket stage of the usual type, and the Shuttle was not a TAOS. Whilethis configuration looked better than the alternative, it still wasnot good enough. The paper concluded that the most cost-effectiveoption of all, more so than any shuttle, was an uprated Titan IIIwith Big Gemini.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[<A NAME="381"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">381</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] By contrast,Fletcher wanted his shuttle and he wanted it very soon. In a letterto Weinberger of October 19, he pressed his point:</FONT></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></I></P><DL>   <DD><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The aerospace industry will be hurt by   continuing indecision and further delay in the shuttle program.

The aerospace industry was set up to build, not to ditherendlessly. Its preliminary-design groups, which had carried forwardthe Shuttle work to date, practiced a highly skilled and specializedtrade; if their efforts were not to bear fruit, their companies wouldbe weakened unless senior management could reassign these people tothe preparation of other proposals.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's Director's Review session took place onOctober 22, and the OMB staff recommendation was blunt: cancel theShuttle program. Staff members also proposed that if this was notfeasible, the decision should be held off for another year, when theOMB would deal with the budget for FY 1974. Weinberger was not eagerto accept such options. Neither was he willing to flatly override hisstaff, even though this was his prerogative, and endorse NASA'sposition. NASA wanted the Mark I/Mark II orbiter with winged S-ICbooster, and Weinberger was interested in alternatives studied by theFlax Committee.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That committee had held a key meeting only aweek earlier, with the OMB staff economist John Sullivan attending asan observer, and Flax had reviewed shuttle alternatives only threedays earlier, in his interim report to the White House's EdwardDavid.

Hetold Don Rice that some sort of shuttle indeed would be approved;NASA would not have to settle for Big Gemini. Rice and his staff,however, would have a free hand to seek lower costs.

Onthat same day, Low addressed a request from Rice and offered his ownpaper, which gave a reply to Flax's interim report of a monthearlier. Flax had discussed a range of alternatives that included BigGemini and a small glider. Low now gave his own range ofalternatives, with each receiving a succinct description. Big Geminiwas conspicuous by its absence, but in other respects, Low's listcovered the most important [<A NAME="384"></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">384</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] configurations of1971.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the high-cost end of this list weretwo-stage reusables, both the fully-reusables of Phase B and thevariant with external hydrogen tanks on the orbiter. In the middlewas the Mark I/Mark II orbiter with a single large tank carrying bothpropellants, and four choices of booster: winged S-IC, singlepressure-fed first stage, TAOS with twin pressure-fed boosters, TAOSwith twin solids. Anchoring the low-cost end was the Titan III-L witha glider carrying payload of 30,000 pounds. Low recommended a versionof TAOS: "The most promising candidate configuration today is theMark I/Mark II orbiter with the parallel-staged pressure-fedbooster," with all engines burning at liftoff.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Low also went to a meeting of the FlaxCommittee and drew a diagram on a blackboard, summarizing the pointsof this paper.

Following Low's presentation to the Flax Committee, itsmembers felt that NASA had "finally come around to somethingreasonable"-with the reasonable thing being the glider, not the TAOSbooster and orbiter. Such a glider also appeared on the option listsof both Low and the OMB staff. Within the White House, Flanigan metwith two of the top executives of North American Rockwell. He toldthem that there definitely would be a Shuttle program, that thegovernment was about ready to make the decision, but that some issuesstill had to be sorted out.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Weinberger had already rejected Big Gemini;Low now argued against the glider. Lacking its own propulsion, itcould not make use of designs such as TAOS to keep the cost perflight within bounds. Instead, a glider would[<A NAME="386"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">386</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] require its own two-stage rocket, which would drivethe cost per flight as high as $35 million.

Low and Myers thus had to put a good deal ofeffort into keeping their troops in line.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This internal NASA debate, paralleling thatbetween NASA and the OMB, brought such contretemps as Max Faget'sreluctance to accept Air Force requirements, the resistance thatHeiss and Lindley encountered when they advocated TAOS, andinsistence at NASA-Marshall that the booster had to be liquid-fueled.The December 2 Space Shuttle, which the OMB proposed and Nixonendorsed a week later, fell outside the bounds of what NASA waswilling to take. Fletcher, dealing with both the White House and theOMB, would promptly declare that it was unacceptable. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Footnotes</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">1</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">.
